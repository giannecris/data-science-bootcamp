"Apple’s next major Mac revealed: the radically new 12-inch MacBook Air","Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple’s first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.

The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides.

KeyboardSilver copy

Besides a new look for the front of the computer, the entire unibody has been revamped from the keyboard to the trackpad to the speakers. Taking cues from the 12-inch PowerBook introduced by Steve Jobs over a decade ago, the new keyboard sits edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop. In addition to going edge-to-edge, the entire key set has been subtly redesigned so that each key sits noticeably closer together. Apple has squeezed the keys closer in order for the computer to be as narrow as possible, which can be seen in the rendition below:

KeyboardSpacing copy

Apple has also relocated some of the function keys across the top and simplified the arrow key array in order to keep the keyboard as narrow as possible without taking away from overall usability. In addition to the keyboard, the trackpad has been changed. The trackpad is approximately the same width as that on the 11-inch MacBook Air (if not ever-so-slightly wider), but it is apparently slightly taller, nearly touching the bottoms of the keyboard and the frame. In line with earlier rumors, it also appears that the new trackpad does not have the same clicking effect as found on current and earlier MacBook models.

ProfileCompare copy

The elimination of physical feedback in the click is part of Apple’s plan to reduce the thickness of the MacBook to a bare minimum. As can be seen in 9to5Mac artist Michael Steeber‘s rendition above, the new 12-inch Air (on the left) is far thinner than the current 11-inch model (on the right). Taking cues from the current Air, the future model has a teardrop-like, tapered design that gets thinner from top to bottom. Above the keyboard are four redesigned speaker grills that actually double as ventilation holes for the fan-less device to keep cool.

The upcoming laptop is so thin that Apple employees are said to refer to the device as the “MacBook Stealth” internally. In order to reach that new level of portability, Apple not only slimmed down the trackpad and tweaked the speakers but the ports as well:

ProfileL-R copy

The upcoming 12-inch Air has the fewest amount of ports ever on an Apple computer, as can be seen in the rendition above. On the right side is a standard headphone jack and dual-microphones for input and noise-canceling. On the left side is solely the new USB Type-C port. Yes, Apple is currently planning to ditch standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and even its Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards on this new notebook. We must note that Apple tests several designs of upcoming products, so Apple may choose to ultimately release a new Air that does include the legacy components, though there is very little space on the edges for them.

As we’ve reported on multiple occasions, the new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers. The connector is able to replace the Thunderbolt Display port on the current Apple laptops as USB Type-C actually has the technology to drive displays. Additionally, the latest specifications from the USB foundation indicate that USB Type-C can actually be used to power computers, which makes the standard MagSafe plugs unnecessary on this new device. The connector is also reversible like Lightning on iPads and iPhones, which should make the overall experience a bit more intuitive. 

KeyboardGray copy

As the new MacBook may only have a single port, it would make sense for Apple to create a hub of some sort for users to be able to plug in multiple devices into the new laptop. Apple already ships all sorts of adapters for its Macs and iOS Devices, so adding yet another attachment to the accessory portfolio would not be unprecedented. With Apple moving to a new “Space Gray” color on its iOS devices and on some Macs (such as with the 2013 Mac Pro), it seems possible that this new MacBook may come in a new gray color, as shown off in some of our renditions.

The latest rumors indicate that the new MacBook Air will ship in mid-2015 (perhaps around WWDC), while other reports have claimed that the new Air is already nearing production. With Intel revealing the latest news on the Broadwell chipset family at CES this week, the ball is likely now in Apple’s court for pushing the future of mobile computing into the world.","1"
"Report: A Radically Redesigned 12-Inch MacBook Air Is Coming","Everyone's been waiting years and years for a meaningful update to the MacBook line. According to a report from 9to5 Mac, this will be the year that a new design will arrive. The blog just published a few renderings based on details from unnamed Apple employees. And if they're correct, this new MacBook looks awesome.

The report comes from 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman, who tends to be a reliable source on all things Apple. The details also match up with many of the rumors about MacBook upgrades in recent years. Chief among them is how Apple will ditch ports almost altogether to achieve a slimmer, sleeker profile. Sources say that prototypes for a new 12-inch MacBook Air are a quarter inch narrower than the current 11-inch model. They also have fewer ports than any other Apple computer: a headphone jack and a single USB Type-C port.

Another less dramatic detail is the slimmer keyboard. Apple's designers are channeling the old 12-inch PowerBook by pushing the keys all the way to the edge. They're also evidently narrowing the amount of space in between the keys to squeeze them together a little bit more. Meanwhile, the trackpad will no longer click in order to make the body thinner. It almost sounds like some sort of feature liquidation, all designed to make this machine as sleek as possible.

It looks pretty amazing, though! If that is what Apple actually does, of course. Click over the 9to5Mac for more on the new laptop design. [9to5Mac]

"Apple may launch 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina Display","Apple would never lower itself to rubbing elbows with the unwashed masses at CES, but it does like to throw out a few announcements during the show to get under everyone’s skin. Cupertino has been quiet thus far, but rumors are swirling about a 12-inch MacBook Air refresh, and this isn’t just a spec bump. Apple is reportedly redesigning the iconic laptop to be even thinner with a higher resolution screen.
Sources inside the company who have used the prototype notebook (code named MacBook Stealth) say it will eschew many of the conventional laptop features in the name of advancing design. The current MacBook Air’s taper toward the front edge, which gives them a very slim profile, but there’s still space near the back for the power connector and full-sized USBs. The new Air, however, won’t be thick enough for a USB port. Instead, Apple will start using the new type-c reversible connectors. There also won’t be an SD card slot or a MagSafe power connector–even Apple’s beloved Thunderbolt is taking a hike. USB will do it all.
MBA
The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn’t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch). Stepping it up to a Retina Display resolution of 2560 x 1600 (like the 13-inch Pro) would be amazing in the Air’s form factor.
profilel-r-copy
To be clear, all the images of this supposed notebook are renders created by 9to5Mac. This is still thoroughly in the rumor category, but it’s a redesign we’ve been expecting for a long time. The updated MacBook Air could be announced in mid-2015.

"Apple's 12-Inch Retina MacBook Air Shown in Artist's Renditions","In a set of artist renditions, 9to5Mac offers a look at Apple's long-rumored 12-inch Retina MacBook Air. The renditions and details shared in the report are consistent with previous reports on the machine, although plans do sometimes change during the development process.

As previously described in rumors, the next MacBook Air will have roughly the same footprint as the current 11-inch model, but include a 12-inch display nestled inside narrower bezels. The machine's keyboard will also extend from edge to edge while the speakers move to a set of grilles above the keyboard.

Comparison of 12-inch Retina MacBook Air (left) with current 11-inch MacBook Air (right)
As part of Apple's effort to reduce the thickness of the MacBook Air, the new 12-inch model will do away with nearly all of the ports currently found on the machine, including the usual USB and MagSafe ports. Instead, the machine's sides will include only a headphone jack, a pair of microphones, and a USB Type-C port that appears set to handle both connectivity and charging.

Apple's new Retina MacBook Air is expected to run on new Broadwell Core M to allow for the thin, fanless design and perhaps come in multiple color options similar to the company's iPhone and iPad lineups. The machine has been rumored to be entering production as soon as this month, although it is unclear whether Apple may wait until its Worldwide Developers Conference in June to launch the device or introduce it earlier in the year.

"Apple’s next MacBook could be a 12-inch MacBook Air","If 9to5Mac’s latest findings are true, than Apple’s biggest product of the year could be the MacBook Air. (You know, right behind the Apple Watch.) According to early reports, Apple has completely redesigned the MacBook Air, ditching the full-sized USB port, MagSafe connector, and SD card slots for something entirely different.

9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman writes: “The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides.”

profilecompare copy
9to5Mac's artist Michael Steeber designed renditions of what the new Air could look like. Here's a side view of the rumored 12-inch Air (left) compared to the current 11-inch Air (right).

Why this matters: We already have an 11-inch MacBook Air... and a 13-inch, too. So, doesn’t a 12-inch just seem unnecessary? To keep up the MacBook Air’s reputation of being ultra-light and ultra-portable, it makes sense to keep the Air’s screen size at 13-inches or less. However, something smaller than 11-inches will just be too small. So, the 12-inch could actually fill that “just right” sweet spot nicely.

It’s not all about the size
However, if 9to5Mac’s design estimates are correct, this is the start of a new design shift for the MacBook Air. We’ll see features that are slimmer and more compact than before, with an edge-to-edge keyboard, a modified trackpad, and a thinner profile (yes, the Air will actually be getting smaller).

Apple could also introduce USB Type-C on the new Air, which means it would no longer need a MagSafe port, as reports on USB Type-C indicate that it can be used to power computers. 9to5Mac believes this single port could be used as a sort of hub, allowing users to plug in multiple devices to the Air.

Of course, this is just speculation at this point—Apple has yet to announce a new MacBook Air officially—but 9to5Mac’s artist renditions are pretty cool. Check out their full report for more details.","1"

Retina MacBook Air release date rumours: When is the new MacBook Air coming out?
The latest 'word on the street' (not our words) sounds to us like a bit of a long shot, but here goes. It's been suggested by a number of websites that Apple will launch its next range of MacBooks during the Christmas holidays.

Aside from the obvious problem (which is that this would be an unbelievable nightmare for us poor souls in the media), this seems to be a case of a reasonable article by Boy Genius Report, written back in August, being rehashed and misinterpreted this month.

For a start, BGR wrote that the next MacBook Air would be ready in time for the Christmas holidays, not launched during them (releasing during the holidays would be a truly bizarre move, denying the products access to the lucrative pre-Christmas shopping period). That nuance seems to have been lost in translation. And beyond this, the article was as we said written in August, at which point a pre-Christmas launch still seemed possible. Now we're pretty much certain that the Retina MacBook Air will have to wait until 2015.

UPDATE, 7 Jan 2015: Sure enough, no MacBook Air appeared over Christmas. The very idea! The latest rumour suggests instead that a radically slimmed-down 12in MacBook Air will launch in mid-2015, perhaps making an appearance at WWDC 2015. See more details and images in the Design section, below.

We've been awaiting the launch of a new MacBook Air for some time. Back in summer 2014 Apple made a few tweaks to the MacBook Air line up, but this was mainly to reduce prices; the processor bump was very slight. Read our reviews of the current MacBook Air range here: 11in 2014 MacBook Air review and MacBook Air 2014, 13in, review.

What people are really waiting for is a new MacBook Air with Intel's (delayed) Broadwell processor, and a Retina display.

The new MacBook Air line up is said to include a completely new 12-inch model which may replace the 11-inch version, giving customers the option of a slighly bigger screen, or it may replace the 13-inch model, where customers could instead opt for the comparitively priced 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display.

So when will this new MacBook Air arrive? Reports in mid June suggested that Apple would begin production of this 12-inch MacBook Air in the third quarter. According to a DigiTimes report, Quanta Computer was set to begin production of the new 12-inch MacBook Air in July. This may have started, if the new Intel chips arrived in time...

They may have: Intel has issued a press release regarding the arrival of its new Core M chip that some believe could be used in the new MacBook Air. A number of manufacturers are already said to be using this new chip in their laptops and tablets, and some of these models will be available in October. According to Intel, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba are all using the Core M.

If this new Intel chip is used by Apple, reports suggest that the new Retina MacBook Air will be available in time for Christmas.

In an August report on Digitimes, the Taiwan-based site claimed that its sources in the Taiwanese supply chain said that the production of components for the new MacBook had begun and that it may launch before the end of this year, or next year.

However, there are also reports that suggest the new Retina MacBook Air could be delayed until next year - it may not be using these Core M chips, relying instead on a different series of Intel Core i5 Broadwell processors (more on that below).

One report even suggests a mid-2015 launch date, claiming that the date has already been pushed back on multiple occasions.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours : Redesign, new colours, thinner design
On 6 January 2015, 9to5Mac posted a series of images that it says show the next MacBook Air's radical new design.

New 12in MacBook Air design mockups by 9to5mac

Bear in mind that these are artist's renders rather than photos of the real thing (although we're sure you'll agree that they're extremely well done - the artist is Michael Steeber). 9to5mac commissioned the images based on information it acquired from sources within Apple ""who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer"".

It isn't entirely clear how much of the design comes from the sources and how much from the artist's imagination, although many of the most major changes (to the keyboard layout, for instance) are obviously in the former category.

Sure enough, the new design is for a laptop with a new screen size: 12 inches. Yet the slimming process in these designs is so extreme that the new 12in MacBook Air actually has a smaller body than the existing 11in MacBook Air. The screen is a little bigger, but everything around the screen has been shrunk.

Here (according to the renders, at any rate) is how the new 12in MacBook Air (left) will compare to the current 11in MacBook Air (right):

New 12in MacBook Air design mockups by 9to5mac

This also partly illustrates the biggest bombshell in these leaks: the new design finds space for only one port on each side of the laptop. It has a USB port on the righthand edge (the new, smaller and reversible, Type-C USB) and a headphone socket, along with a couple of microphone holes, on the left. If this is right, the MacBook will have to be powered via the USB port - and sure enough, USB Type-C will be perfectly adequate for that purpose. It just means that you won't be able to use a USB hard drive, wired mouse (or wireless mouse dongle) or other USB accessory while the MacBook is plugged in.

Macworld contributor Kirk McElhearn is one of the sceptics who have pointed out the numerous inconveniences this would impose, and it's possible - likely, we would say - that the eventual layout will be less extreme. We think the MagSafe power connection is likely to survive. 

As we mentioned briefly, the keyboard is also designed differently. The power button now sits next to the Esc key at the top-left corner of the keyboard, and the keys have in general been shrunk down and squeezed together. The trackpad, on the other hand, has been expanded and now comes closer to the keys.

New 12in MacBook Air design mockups by 9to5mac

Of course, 9to5mac's images aren't the first apparent leak about the next MacBook Air's design.

Jack Marsh, a 16-year-old blogger who appears to have a source with plausible information about the new MacBook Air, seems to have become the the go-to blogger for all MacBook Air rumours. There have certainly been other young bloggers who have gained insight into unannounced Apple products, but as yet we can't be sure the claims are legitimate.

Marsh has a rumour about the MacBook Air to add to an earlier rumour that suggested the new model would come in gold, silver and space grey finishes (more on that below). Now he claims his source has told him that the new design is so thin Apple has had to switch to a new reversible USB Type C connector which is significantly smaller than USB 3 (it's 8.4x2.6mm).

Apparently the MagSafe port is also getting a redesign for the same reason: the laptop chassis is too thin to accomodate the current MagSafe charger. Indeed the MacBook Air may charge in an entirely new way, although Marsh's source wasn't clear on whether this had been finalised yet.

The MacBook Air is also said to feature thin bezels with a keyboard that stretches to the edge of the laptop. Marsh also claims his source told him: ""The display bezels are noticeably thinner - quite similar to the current MacBook Pro Retina lineup.""

Marsh's earlier report claimed that the new MacBook Air will come in iPhone-like space grey and gold finishes, as well as the usual aluminium.

MacRumors lent some credibility to this inisial report, claiming that they are aware that ""Apple has at least considered launching the 12in notebook with several different 'special edition' colour options"". And it wouldn't be the first time Apple has introduced a range of colour choices on their Mac laptops.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: 12-inch screen
Many of the new MacBook Air rumours suggest this model will feature a 12in screen.

Some sources point to evidence that Apple is working with 12in screens, but there have been claims that Quanta Computer will be building a rumoured 12-inch iPad later this year and it could be the iPad Pro that is being referred to here.

According to a DigiTimes report in June, sources claim Apple wishes to introduce a smaller MacBook Air to make clearer the distinction between the 11-inch MacBook Air and the iPad Air with its 9.7-inch screen.

Canalys analyst Daniel Matte also believes Apple is working on a new version of the MacBook Air - one with a 11.88in screen. Other rumours place the screen size at 12in (which probably matches Matte's expectations).

In his blog Matte seems to be suggesting that there may only be one MacBook Air - this new 12-inch model, with the 13-inch model being phased out in favour of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display.

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested back in October 2013 that Apple will launch a 12-inch MacBook Air in 2014. Kuo suggested that this new MacBook Air would have an entirely new design.

The smaller 12in model could still accommodate a reasonably sized screen and keyboard if it had a smaller bezel.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Fanless design
The new MacBook Air is also said to be even thinner than the existing MacBook Air. This is based on the theory that it will use Intel's new Intel Core M processor, a chip that doesn't need fans. By using this processor it is claimed that Apple could make the laptop 9mm thin. The MacBook Air is currently 0.3-1.7cm thick so it could be almost 1cm thinner at its thickest point.

Apparently the fan assembly is the reason why the MacBook Air is thicker at one end than the other. Removing the fan assembly would enable Apple to make the laptop thinner than ever, according to reports.

Presumably there will be some sort of cooling system built in, but that may not be necessary. The new Intel processors are said to be efficient enough to make the removal of the fan feasible - indeed there are already laptops on the market that do not feature a fan.

Even the Core M may still require cooling in a 12in laptop, though. The new Broadwell processor should enable a fanless design for the smaller (up to 11.6in) laptop or mobile device, notes Motley Fool, based on what Intel said at its developer forum in 2013.

It has been suggested that the MacBook Air could also offer thermal scaling and thermal management.

Another advantage of a fanless design would be quiet operation. There would also be no moving parts (making it less likely to break), and it could also offer higher battery capacity because the remaining space could be used to house a bigger battery.

(We can't help but worry that history could repeat itself if the MacBook Air is fan free - Steve Jobs famously refused to include a fan in the Apple III, leading to hardware failure.)

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: USB Type C
If Marsh's source (above) is correct the new MacBook Air may offer USB Type C support, which is smaller than USB 3 (it's 8.4x2.6mm). USB Type C is able to support 10Gbps data transfers, which is twice as fast as USB 3, but still slower than Thunderbolt 2 (although the same as the older Thunderbolt 1).

It will also support for up to 100 watts of power, which is apparently enough to power 4K displays, as Apple's Thunderbolt cable does currently. The only problem is that USB Type C isn't backwards-compatible.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Inductive charging
Marsh's source also claims that the MagSafe port may get a redesign and that the MacBook Air may charge in an entirely new way. Perhaps the new MacBook Air will use inductive charging like the Apple Watch does.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Trackpad changes
According to a report on Chinese site Weiphone earlier this year, the new MacBook Air will be thinner and lighter, a feat it will achieve by removing the fan and the clicking mechanism in the trackpad.

The new 12in model will drop the trackpad and introduce ""force and optical sensors"" and new touch gestures, according to this report from BEN Latest News.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Retina display
Will the next MacBook Air feature a Retina display? That's one of the strongest and most persistent rumours, and it's certainly possible.

Apple may opt to keep prices down (and battery life up) by keeping the screen non-Retina; but we don't think so. According to our own reviews of the MacBook Air, the MacBook Air is currently let down by its display, which has a lower resolution than the competition.

Canalys analyst Daniel Matte has written a blog claiming that Apple will add a Retina display to the MacBook Air this year. He expects that we will see a 11.88-inch model with a resolution of 2,732x1,536 pixels, the same 264ppi that the iPad Air offers.

He explains the significance of Apple using the same display technology for the MacBook Air and iPad Air, stating: ""It turns out that an ~11.88"" Retina MacBook Air with a 2732 x 1536 resolution happens to have the exact same pixel density as the 9.7"" 2048 x 1536 Retina iPads: ~264 PPI. It would make sense for Apple to take advantage of the same display technology it has been utilizing for the 9.7"" iPads by cutting their panels to this larger size.""

Rumours also claim that the new MacBook Air Retina display could have a resolution of 2,304 x 1,440 for a rumoured 12in display (discussed below). That's 226 pixels per inch, compared to 227 pixels per inch for the 13in MacBook Pro (which offers 2,560-by-1,600 resolution). This adds up to a 16:10 aspect ratio like that found on the 13in MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models, rather than the 16:9 aspect ratio currently offered by the 11in MacBook Air.

The current 11.6-inch MacBook Air offers a 1366 x 768 pixel display.

The rumours of a MacBook Air with Retina display have been long running. Back in February 2013, rumours suggested that Apple was planning to launch a revamped MacBook Air with a Retina display in the third-quarter of 2013. A separate report in March 2013 also claimed that Apple would introduce a Retina display to the MacBook Air in 2013. Since this didn't happen in 2013, it is perhaps likely for 2014. 

Apple does appear to be moving the whole of its range to Retina display. The company updated the Retina versions of its MacBook Pro in 2013, and also introduced a Retina iPad mini in October 2013. 

Wondering what the Retina display fuss is all about? Read: What's a Retina display, and what's a Retina HD display?

Apple may use the IGZO display technology for the new display, offering improved power efficiency. The reason for the supposition is that Apple was recruiting for a engineers with experience in LED backlighting and LCD displays, in February, according to CultofMac. In an LCD display the bunches of pixels with wires running behind to connect them. The backlight has to shine though this mesh of wires to light up the pixels. In an IGZO display more light is able to shine though this mesh of wires, so the power requirements are lower, and battery life can be preserved. As a result we could see even longer battery life than the 12 hours currently on offer from the 13in MacBook Air.

Rumours about a Retina MacBook Air with a smaller display have been circulating for some time. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested back in October 2013 that Apple will launch a 12-inch MacBook Air in 2014. Kuo suggested that this new MacBook Air would have an entirely new design.

Then back in January 2014, Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang predicted that a 12in MacBook/iPad hybrid would launch in the autumn of 2014. It is possible that the rumoured Retina display MacBook Air could be this Mac.

Canalys analyst Daniel Matte also believes Apple will add a Retina display to the MacBook Air this year.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Processor
Intel has announced the new Intel Core M chip. Some expect that this processor may be used by Apple inside the new MacBook Air. As mentioned above, because this chip doesn't need fans, the new MacBook Air could be less than a centimeter thick at its thickest point. Since it uses the 14nm processor, the processor itself it is tiny.

The Core M processor should also enable the new MacBook to be more power-efficient with better battery life. Intel claims it's the most energy-efficient chip yet.

The Core M also offers excellent graphics processing power, according to Intel. Intel says it will offer seven times the graphics power of four-year-old machines, and double the graphical and three times the web performance of the current range of high-end tablets.

However, Intel has not confirmed that Apple will use the new processor. (In the press release regarding the new chip, Intel mentions Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba as potentially using the Core M. Some of these models will be available in October, according to Intel.)

The Core M is designed for small laptops, large tablets and 2-in-1 devices, and Intel is positioning the chips as being for use in laptops of 13.3in, tablets above 10in and dual devices. Apple would traditionally use the Core i5 chips in its MacBook, so it is possible that these processors will never appear in a MacBook Air which may instead use the new U Broadwell processor, which may not ship until 2015.

Redmond Pie reports that performance with the Core M hasn't been particularly impressive; it was featured in the Lenovo Yogo 3 Pro, which didn't exactly set the world alight: benchmark speed tests and overall reviews rated the device quite poorly. It's therefore been suggested that Apple may give the Core M a miss and go instead for an i5 or i7 chip.

(On the other hand, some analysts have argued that Lenovo's implementation of the Core M, rather than the innate qualities of the Core M itself, was to blame for the sub-standard performance, and that Apple's engineers would be able to coax solid performance from a Core M-equipped MacBook Air. We shall see.)

Whichever Broadwell processor Apple does use, it should make the Retina display MacBook Air possible. Broadwell is said to consume 30 percent less power than its predecessor Haswell, and that should be good news for battery life on the portable Macs, especially those with power hungry screens.

Other features of the Broadwell chip are that it is low power and offers integration with WiDi, 4G WWAN and WiGig networks.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: May not use Intel chips
This rumour has been floating around for some time. It is possible that Apple will ditch the Intel processor in its range of laptop in favour of its own home-made A-series chips, like those found in the iPad and iPhone.  

Some have even speculated that the new MacBook Air could mark some sort of crossover between the iPad and the MacBook, perhaps an iPad Pro.

However, rumours that Apple will move from Intel to ARM chips seem unlikely, based on this explaination from Cult of Mac.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: UK price
With the price of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with Retina display being so close we had expected that Apple would reduce the price of the entry-level MacBook even further. It's currently £749 for the 11in model, which is £100 less than in 2013. This compares to the MacBook Pro Retina starting price of £999. However, the fact that the top-of the range iPhone 6 Plus costs more than the entry level MacBook Air (£789) makes us think that the MacBook Air price is more likely to increase.

It may be that the 13-inch MacBook Air is discontinued, as that model is similar in price to the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina, but not equal in specs. This would leave the cheaper 12-inch MacBook Air models with, potentially, an entry-level price of £800.

When it first launched in October 2012, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display started at £1,449. This was reduced to £1,249 a few months later when the range received a processor upgrade. Now, with the April 2014 update to the MacBook Air, the entry-level price of the 13-inch model is a much more compelling £999 which makes the difference between the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display and the 13-inch MacBook Air £250 rather than £150.

In his predictions last year, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the price of this new 12-inch MacBook Air model could be lower than the current line up of Mac laptops.

Didn't Apple already introduce the 2014 MacBook Air?
Apple unveiled the latest update to the MacBook Air on 29 April 2014.  Quietly updating its MacBook Air line-up with improved Haswell processors from Intel. You can read our review of the 2014 11in MacBook Air and the review of the 13in MacBook Air here.

Aside from the small processor boost and a tiny battery life tweak, the main change for the new MacBook Air models was the price. Each model is now under £1,000, with prices starting at £749, £100 less than the previous models. This helps keep the MacBook Air an attractive option for customers, as the previous price was not much different to the price of the new MacBook Pro with Retina display.

The range update came as some surprise as the Retina display for the MacBook Air rumour was already in circulation. Prior to the MacBook Air update in April, there were suggestions that the new MacBook Air with Retina display could launch at WWDC, but this was obviously not the case.

Why is the Retina MacBook Air delayed?
If there is a delay, the key reason may be the availability of Intel processors, rather than the production of the new design.

Intel's newest generation of chips - the successor to the Haswell chips currently in the MacBook Air - called Broadwell has been plagued by delays. However, in a conference call about Intel's second-quarter results on 15 July, Intel's chief executive Brian Krzanich confirmed Intel’s hardware partners will have Broadwell systems on store shelves in the run up to Christmas. He said: ""We said we would have products on shelves for the holiday season and we continue to work with our partners and we’re on schedule to have product on shelf in the holiday.""

As we mention above, some of these new chips are now shipping, however, anyone awaiting the new Retina MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac and Mac mini should note that there are various Broadwell chips being developed by Intel, and the chips that Intel confirmed are shipping now are the M variety, destined for fanless two-in-ones. The new MacBook Air may use the U Broadwell processor, which may not ship until 2015.

We are sure that Apple is pretty frustrated with Intel.

Shipment of Skylake – the successor to Broadwell which will offer even more power than that chip - is also delayed.

New Retina MacBook Air release date: Will the MacBook Air be an iPad Pro?
There are also rumours that Apple could launch a 12in iPad, but this might not arrive until 2015, or the rumours could relate to the 12in MacBook.

There are also rumours that the new MacBook Air merge with the iPad to create the iPad Pro. You can read more about the iPad Pro rumours here.

We think that a MacBook Air that offered a dual boot system for iOS 7 and Mac OS X would be very interesting, however, Tim Cook last year ruled out any kind of convergence suggesting that a Toaster Refrigerator wouldn't work.

Will the old non-Retina MacBook Air remain?
If Apple launches a 12in MacBook Air, will it discontinue the existing models? It's possible that if Apple launches a 12in Retina MacBook Air model it will discontinue both, or either of the existing models. Equally, Apple could maintain one of the existing models as an entry-level model. It seems more likely that it would keep the 11in model on at an even lower price, rather than keep on the bigger 13in model.

One reason why Apple may keep a lower-priced MacBook Air on is the fact that Apple has just introduced a new entry-level iMac and already the MacBook Air looks superior to that, despite costing less. If Apple wants a low end option, it would appear unlekely that the Retina MacBook Air would be it.

Read our review of the new £899 iMac and see how it compares to the MacBook Air.

The new MacBook Air will be solar-powered
Ok, so this is a bit of an out-there rumour, but it really is possible that Apple will one day release a new MacBook Air with a solar powered display.

In January 2013, Apple was granted a patent that described a method for harnessing sunlight to illuminate a MacBook's display. This patent is actually the seventh solar-related patent Apple has gained in the past two years.

New Retina MacBook Air leaked images
At present, there are no new MacBook Air leaked images to share with you, but we will update this story as soon as one surfaces on the web.

We have seen a few concept images, however...

Perhaps inspired by the Mac Pro, or the Space Grey iPhone 5s, there are calls for a black version of the MacBook Air. TUAW has provided some renders of how such a MacBook Air could look.

"Report: new 12-inch MacBook Air slims down, has single USB port","According to a new report from 9to5Mac, a new MacBook Air is coming. The new computer is alleged to have a12-inch screen, but remain about the size of the 11-inch model via reduced bezels on all sides. Possibly even cooler than that is the computer is said to be an actual thing, not like the iPad Pro we keep hearing about. Sources inside Apple claim to have been hands-on with the new device, which is also lighter than existing MacBook Airs.

Aside from sporting a larger screen and lighter design, there are several other interesting nuances, here. The new-look MacBook is sporting a single USB Type-C port, which sounds silly — but isn’t.

The USB Type-C port can handle things you’ve been relying on other ports to do for years, like external monitors. the new USB standard is also capable of charging, so MagSafes might be dead.

That also means no multiple USB ports, SD Card slot, Thunderbolt — and you won’t be able to natively charge and use an external monitor. The natural assumption here is that Apple will release some sort of hub alongside the new MacBook Air for those occasions when multitasking is necessary.

profilel-r-copy

The trackpad is said to be a touch bigger than the existing MacBook Air models (and get rid of the click), but the keyboard has reportedly been minimized to accommodate the slimmer profile. That means smaller keys, closer together, even though the keyboard is said to go edge-to-edge.

The report details the device as overall slimmer than the existing MacBook Air 11-inch (which sounds insane), but a touch taller to accommodate the larger 12-inch screen. Speaker grilles toward the top of the keyboard double as vents for the CPU, too.

What news don’t we get, here? Retina. Sadly, nothing in the report suggest we’ll get a Retina MacBook Air with the refresh. Fans of the dense Apple screens won’t find favor there, but we’ll all still marvel at the thin profile, should this actually come to pass as reported.

"Apple 'working on 12-inch MacBook Air'","Apple is planning to release its slimmest MacBook yet, boasting a single USB port and 12-inch display, according to a new report.

Rumours site 9to5Mac created artist renditions of the revamped model based on information from sources within the company, which it says in the first major shakeup of the Mac line since the introduction of the Retina MacBook Pro in 2012.

The 12-inch model would slot neatly into the current range, which is comprised of an 11-inch and 13-inch model. The new version is slimmer than both predecessors, but sports the same 'tapered' design from top to bottom.

But such a slimline frame comes at a price; as Apple appears to have done away with standard USB ports and SD card slot. A single USB Type-C port remains, and the gaps between keyboard keys narrowed in order to minimise space.

Four speaker grills positioned between the screen and keyboard double up as ventilation, as the model has no fan. The trackpad is taller than that of the 11-inch model, and the keyboard has been designed to sit edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop, with a notably slimmer margin.

UK pricing and the release date of the potential new model remain unknown.

The first MacBook Air was introduced by former chief executive Steve Jobs at the 2008 Macworld Conference and Expo, where he claimed the company had built the world's thinnest notebook. The MacBook Air replacing the white MacBook as the standard entry model after its discontinuation in 2011.

The news comes as reports circulate that Apple is preparing for the Apple Watch to go on sale by the end of March.

"Is Apple about to launch a totally redesigned, 12-inch MacBook Air?","Every year, Apple does some counterprogramming at CES. This year, whether it meant to or not, it may have some big news: 9to5Mac has some new details that say there's a 12-inch MacBook Air with a completely new design, a higher-resolution display, and few of the trappings we've come to expect from a MacBook Air.

Here's Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac:

Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple’s first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.
According to Gurman's sources, there are a number of other changes as well. The function keys and arrow keys have been redesigned, and the keyboard sits completely edge to edge on the palmrest. It's smaller and narrower, apparently, and the trackpad doesn't have the same clicking feedback. Of course, let's be clear: these are leaks and sources, who are often working with incomplete and occasionally incorrect information. Things also change, a lot, between leaks and release. But also, Mark Gurman has a long history of being right.

These photos, too, are not real. They are renderings, guesses as to what the Macbook might be. But if these sources are right, confirming rumors we've been hearing for months and years — of a lighter, thinner, higher-res MacBook Air — 2015 could be a big year for Apple's laptops.","1"
"Why the Gold Apple Watch Edition Must Cost $10,000","Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the “18-karat gold” Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!

Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, “The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition“

Gold is Expensive

Let’s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don’t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.

Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit “back of the envelope.” Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic…

Here are the basic facts:

Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.
18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.
One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.
18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc.
.25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!

Gold Watches are Expensive

Let’s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it’s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let’s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 – 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.

A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost over $8,300
A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200
Now let’s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That’s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you’re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.

How does this translate in the real world? Let’s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.

This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold
This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold
The Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k gold
Cartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 street
Cartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 street
The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k gold
Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 street
Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 street
This list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it’s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.

Then there’s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!

Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.

Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can’t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.

The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000

There’s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker’s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!

Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That’s not going to happen. So they’re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.

First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.

Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, “solid” in their press releases, they do claim it is “crafted from 18-karat gold” and nowhere does it say it is plated or “gold filled” (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.

Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it’s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.

Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as “standard gold”. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.

My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it’s possible with some finagling and if that’s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.

This is a $10,000 product
This is a $10,000 product
Bonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.

Update!

Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine I’ll hear from lots of them real soon!

The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there’s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX  (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.


I think this number is way too low, but it’s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he’s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.

Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it’s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it’s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we’re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.

So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let’s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we’re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, “If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.”

Regardless of the total, it’s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver’s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.

I’d love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece. Thanks for reading!","1"
"Why the most expensive Apple Watch will probably cost around $10,000","The most expensive Apple Watch set to go on sale in April will have to cost around $10,000, according to analysis done by the timepiece blog Grail Watch.

That's mostly because the Apple Watch Edition has a frame made from solid 18-karat gold, which is very expensive.

Grail Watch notes that gold sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per ounce these days. By that measure, the Apple Watch Edition's frame would cost around $8,300 for the larger 42mm version, excluding all other costs.

That's assuming the watch's case is made from solid gold, not gold-plated. But the blog notes that Apple's marketing material never uses ""gold-plated"" or ""gold-filled,"" which is conventional terminology for gold-plated materials, and that Apple must abide by laws governing how jewelry makers describe their products.

The conventional wisdom so far has been that the Apple Watch Edition will cost $5,000. Apple has only announced the price of the low-end Apple Watch Sport, which will sell for $349.

But gold-framed luxury watches usually go for well above the $10,000 mark. Cartier's Tank MC lists for $22,000 and Jager-LeCoultre's Reverso Squadra Hometime lists for over $23,000.

Even if the Apple Watch Edition sells for less than its analog competitors, it will still be Apple's most expensive product.

Grail Watch predicts the larger Apple Watch Edition will go for $9,999, with the smaller version retailing for $7,999.","1"
"Gold Apple Watch Edition price? Speculators say at least $10,000","The Apple Watch will not be an accessory for your iPhone - but your iPhone will be an accessory for your Apple Watch, claims technology writer John Gruber, who expects the new wearable to cost upwards of $10,000 (£6,500/€8,800). Due to go on sale in April, the Apple Watch will start at $349 for the basic Sport model with a rubber strap, but beyond that no one knows how much the stainless steel and 18-karat gold Edition models will cost. A debate between technology and wristwatch experts is under way to determine how far into uncharted water Apple is willing to sail. First, Stephen Foskett of Grail Watch chimed in, suggesting (although using self-proclaimed ""back of envelope"" maths) the gold Apple Watch Edition will cost at least $10,000, based on the materials used. Foskett points to the huge gap in prices between stainless steel and gold versions of Swiss watches of a similar size and shape to the Apple Watch, noting how the Cartier Tank - a watch praised by Apple design chief Jony Ive - costs $7,000 in steel and $22,000 in pink gold. The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime, slightly larger than the 42mm Apple Watch, costs $8,550 in steel and $23,000 in gold - and a gold strap is a further $20,000. Apple must also price the Watch so it is protected against the volatility of gold. Foskett said: ""[Watchmakers] can't price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labour, distribution and profit in a watch."" Will the Apple Watch be gold plated to save costs? Apple Watch will go on sale before the end of April(Apple) Foskett says not. Although Apple doesn't describe the Watch Edition as being ""solid gold,"" it does say it is ""crafted from 18-karat gold,"" and nowhere is the material described as plated or gold filled. Entering the jewellery market means complying with new regulation, Foskett explains. ""There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could."" Add to this Apple's claims of producing the Watch from gold twice as hard as standard gold, and it is clear that the company will not be scrimping on materials. Foskett believes $9,999 for the 42mm model and $7,999 for the 38mm version of the gold Watch Edition could well be possible. Days later, Apple commentator John Gruber blogged to say he also thinks the price will be $10,000. ""The more I think about it, and the more I learn about the watch industry, the world of luxury goods, and the booming upper class of China, the better I feel about that bet. I don't think I was wrong to place a friendly late night bar bet on a $9,999 starting price [for the gold model]."" Gold straps Gruber says a ""starting price"" because he expects Apple to announce a new gold band when the Watch finally gets a price and release date - and for this he suspects the company will charge an additional $10,000. Looking at how Rolex charges a much higher premium for its gold models over steel - and for watches with identical movements - Gruber says the Apple Watch Edition ""is not a tech product, so don't try to price it like one... Apple's ambitions in this arena, I am convinced, are almost boundless."" Buying the Watch Edition will be unlike buying any other product in Apple's history. Reports claim the company will store the watches in safes, and that it is even considering completely separate boutique stores to sell them. Apple is expected to reveal the Watch's pricing structure and release date at a media event before the end of April 2014.

"Would you pay $10,000 for the Apple Watch?","VENICE BEACH, Calif. --You've probably heard Apple is launching its latest i-device, a new Apple Watch, in April and that it will start at $350.

But did you know there are three editions of the watch? What no one knows, outside of Apple, is how much the top of the line ""Watch Edition"" will sell for.

We've seen online reports that it could sell for as much as $4,000. Maybe more.

So we got to wondering: How much would consumers pay for the top-of-the-line Apple Watch?

Not much, as we recently found out in chats with consumers here.

""I'd get the $350 model,"" says Ashlea Fellows of Australia. ""I wouldn't go any higher.""

Thousands of dollars for a gold watch? Not for Karla Gallegos of Chile. ""Too expensive. I could find a watch made of gold for $2,000,"" she said.

Juan Frias of New York would drop $1,000. ""I like gold watches,"" he says. ""I'm a teacher, and I wouldn't have to look down at my wrist. My daughter texts me, I can look and nobody can say, `Hey, you're on the phone.'""

Apple touts the high-end Apple Watch as sporting a 18-karat gold case, which it says is twice as hard as standard gold. And it's protected by sapphire crystal, advertised as almost impossible to break, unlike the gorilla glass of the iPhone.

In mid-2014, many analysts expected Apple to use sapphire glass on the iPhone 6, but that didn't happen. Apple wasn't happy with the sapphire being produced by its factory near Phoenix, which has since been shut down. The company hasn't said where its new sapphire is being produced.

Estimates online for how much Apple will charge for the top-line watch are all over the map. Website Grail-watch.com goes as high as $10,000. ""t's pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size,"" notes the site.

But even at $4,000 or $5,000, the price tag will make it easily the most expensive item at the Apple Store. It's most expensive computer, the MacPro, starts at around $3,000.

Apple's high-priced watch will be in good company -- and even if it tops the most optimistic estimates, it will be still be way cheaper than the gold standard of luxury watches, the Rolex. Amazon's Rolex page starts at $4,000 and goes all the way up to $62,000.

But those watches don't read back texts or control your music.

With such expensive i-jewelry on display at shopping malls across the world, will it change the way people shop at the Apple Store? Will folks be wary of walking out of the store with a multi-thousand-dollar gold watch on their wrists?

Paul Wallace of Long Beach, Calif., admits that sporting a gold Apple watch on his wrist would make him a target. ""It would….but you've got to go Gold,"" he said. ""If you've got it, flaunt it.""

"Don’t cancel your ski plans, Apple’s not having an event in Feb.","Contrary to a report from the often-reliable French blog iGen.fr, Apple is apparently not planning a media event late this month to introduce the Apple Watch or other new products, sources tell 9to5Mac.

Several media reports picked up the rumor today, repeating claims that Apple has planned an event for the last week of February, perhaps February 24. The blog speculated that the event could also include the introduction of the in development 12-inch MacBook we revealed earlier this year.


 
While it’s highly likely that Apple will hold an advance event to officially launch the Apple Watch and begin preorders ahead of shipping, the actual date remains a question mark. The French report suggested that Apple could use a late February event to begin a major media push ahead of the Apple Watch’s release, informing developers about last-minute details pertinent to app development. Though Tim Cook has confirmed that the Apple Watch will ship in April during the company’s recent earnings call, the specific release date, pricing, and other launch-related details have been left ambiguous. 

An event in February would have been a change for Apple based on recent years, though the last week of the month has often been when invites go out ahead of events held in early March. Apple’s last event in March was its new iPad and third-gen Apple TV event in 2012, while its last event in February was for the iPod Hi-Fi back in 2006.

"Apple plans relaunched Beats streaming music service for WWDC, skipping March event; Apple TV still coming","Apple won’t take the wraps off of its upcoming Beats-based music streaming service at its March 9 “Spring Forward” event, according to music industry sources briefed on the launch timeline. Instead, Apple currently plans to introduce the service, at least in beta form, at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in early June. The WWDC keynote takes place on Monday, June 8th, so that’s when the debut will likely occur. The new iTunes music streaming service is based on technology acquired from Beats Music, including curated playlists, cloud-based libraries, and offerings customized to the musical tastes of individual users. The service will be priced as high as $7.99 per month, which is less expensive than current $9.99 pricing for Beats Music, Spotify, and Rdio…
 
The service was initially planned for launch earlier in 2015, but was delayed by the departures of key employees, as well as difficulties integrating Beats human and technology resources into Apple. Some Beats executives such as Bobby Gaza, who was a Senior Vice President at Beats in charge of technology, have departed Apple in recent weeks. The new Apple-made service will also make way for Apple’s first entirely-in-house Android application, but sources say that delays to the Android app are also possible as some of Apple’s Android developers have also left the company. Apple has, not coincidentally, published job listings for Android developers in recent days.

Apple currently plans to launch the new music service as part of an iOS 8.4 upgrade for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch following WWDC, but a final decision has not yet been made. It’s possible that the service will be bundled into iOS 9 this fall, which is expected to have a significant focus on bug fixes and stability improvements. The service will be integrated into the standard iOS Music application and will function similarly to Beats Music for iPhone, but it will have an entirely Apple-designed aesthetic that matches the Music app and iOS. On the Mac side, the new service will be implemented with an iTunes update.

As for the Apple TV, the new service will be an app that replaces the existing Beats channel. Sources say that Apple is also finishing up work on a slimmer Apple TV set-top-box with a more capable and tactile remote control and a redesigned operating system bundled with an App Store. As of last fall, Apple had hoped to debut a new set top box as soon as this month, but with reports of the discussions between Apple and content providers being in only “early stages”, it seems that, just like last year, content roadblocks could keep the new Apple TV from debuting until another point in the future. As we learned yesterday regarding the larger iPad Pro, Apple will have another busy fall, so perhaps the new Apple TV will launch later in the year.

While the streaming service won’t debut at the March event, as some had hoped, Apple still has plenty to talk about. The Apple Watch will be the cornerstone of the event, where sources expect Apple to spend a significant amount of time introducing and demonstrating third-party WatchKit applications as selling points for the device. It is also highly likely that Apple will discuss the rest of the price points for the device and its accessories before the April ship date. Apple has a redesigned MacBook Air with Retina display in the works for this year, but it remains unclear whether Apple actually plans to debut the computer at the March event.","1"
"Apple might finally unveil the Retina MacBook Air of your dreams next week","Apple may take time during its upcoming media event on March 9 to talk about more than just the impending Apple Watch launch. According to The Michael Report, Apple next week will finally introduce the long-rumored 12-inch Retina MacBook Air.

Many are expecting Apple [to] talk more about the Apple Watch. However, sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.

There are few things worth mentioning here.

First, a Retina MacBook Air has been a long time coming. The first iteration of the Retina MacBook Pro first launched back in June of 2012. Now we’re already well into 2015 and it’s about time that the MacBook Air received some Retina love. Indeed, rumors of a Retina MacBook Air being in the works stretch all the way back to 2013.

Second, reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (who has an incredibly accurate track record when it comes to Apple rumors) issued a research report last month indicating that Apple has plans to release a Retina MacBook Air sometime during the first quarter of 2015. Further, we reported this past September that Apple was eyeing a mid-2015 release date for a new MacBook Air model.

Third, the technology to support a Retina Display on such a compact notebook is finally right around the corner. Remember that a Retina Display, with so many pixels in play, naturally drains up more battery power during day to day use, a fact which likely explains why the product was reportedly prone to developmental delays. Apple, after all, prides itself on best in class battery life and it would much rather wait than rush to release a laptop with shoddy battery life. That said, Apple’s upcoming notebooks will likely feature Intel’s next-gen Broadwell processors which promise to deliver a discernible increase in power efficiency.

Putting all of these factors together, it certainly seems more than plausible that Apple will introduce a new member to its notebook lineup come next Monday.

Lastly, there are two more details to keep an eye on: First, a tantalizing rumor from a few months ago claimed that Apple’s next-gen MacBook Air will be available in new color options: Space Grey and Gold, to be exact. And second, if a 12-inch Retina MacBook Air is released, some reports have claimed that Apple, in turn, will lower the pricepoints on the 11-inch and 13-inch MacBook Air models.","1"
"EXCLUSIVE: Apple To Unveil The Long-Awaited Retina MacBook Air At Its “Spring Forward” Event","Last week, Apple sent out the invites for its “Spring Forward” event, slated to be held at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco on March 9th.

Many are expecting Apple talk more about the Apple Watch. However, sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.

We should note that this information falls in line with what Apple analysts such as KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo and Oppenheimer’s Andrew Uerkwitz have been predicting for months. Supply chain sources who spoke to the press have also said that Apple ramped up their production in late 2014 and entered the mass production stage in December, with the goal of producing enough units for an early-2015 debut.

Apple’s MacBook Air line, which got upgraded in April last year (the only real upgrade being a small speed bump), still features a non-Retina screen with the same screen resolution that hasn’t been updated since late 2010. This is a stark contrast from the rest of the Apple computer lineup, which have been steadily upgraded to a Retina (or at least, a version of it is offered) screen since the first Retina MacBook Pro was unveiled in 2012.

The upcoming Retina MacBook Air, if earlier reports are to be believed, will come in an ultra slim design that combines the productivity of the current larger-screened 13-inch MacBook Air with the portability of the 11-inch MacBook Air.

Internally, the new Retina MacBook Air is said to feature Intel’s next-generation Broadwell Core M low-power processors, which would allow Apple to strip the computer of its fan assembly to create an even thinner profile. Other compromises Apple reportedly made in exchange for a thinner and lighter body includes the full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors and SD card slots.

The Retina MacBook Air, currently codenamed “MacBook Stealth” internally, will also come with a modest price decrease according to previous reports.","1"
"Apple could surprise us with 12-inch MacBook Air next week","The Apple Watch is expected to be the main attraction at next week’s “Spring Forward” event, but according to a new report, the long-rumored 12-inch Retina MacBook Air could make a surprise appearance at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.

The sketchy rumor comes from the Michael Report, which claims its sources inside Apple say the company’s long-awaited update to the MacBook Air will be announced March 9.

“Sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.”

Obviously, we can’t verify the accuracy of the report. The Michael Report unearthed full details of the iPad Air 2 before the product’s announcement in October of last year, however, the publication also whiffed on some iPhone 6 launch details, including the name of the iPhone 6 Plus, and the Nexus 6.

We’re not really expecting any hardware other than the Apple Watch at next week’s event, but Cupertino could surprise us. The last time the MacBook Air line was upgraded was April 2014, which was just a small spec bump, so it’s due for an update.

Hardware leaks of the 12-inch MacBook Air have been scarce, although multiple reports have confirmed that Apple is working on the device. The new Retina MacBook Air will supposedly feature a fan-less design made possible by Intel’s next-gen Broadwell processors. It’s also rumored that the new device will only have one USB-C port and a headphone jack.","1"
"Rumor Suggests 12-Inch Retina MacBook Air Could Launch During March 9 Apple Watch Event","Apple could be planning to introduce the much-rumored 12-inch Retina MacBook Air during its March 9 Apple Watch event, according to one site that claims to have sources within Apple. The Michael Report believes Apple will use the event to debut the ultrathin MacBook, which is rumored to have a Retina display and a redesigned chassis.Many are expecting Apple talk more about the Apple Watch. However, sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.While there have been no concrete rumors from major sites linking the Retina MacBook Air to Apple's March 9 event, previous rumors have indicated that Apple is planning for a spring release. Apple supplier Quanta is said to have begun mass production of the notebook in January, and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted a March launch for the MacBook.

Rendering of the 12-inch Retina MacBook Air created by Martin Hajek
When taking these rumors into account, along with the fact that the MacBook Air is due for an update, the introduction of the Retina MacBook Air at Apple's March 9 event does seem like a possibility. It's also possible Apple will introduce new models of the existing 11 and 13-inch MacBook Air at the event -- the last update was in April and there was a rumor suggesting an update in February was imminent. Core M Broadwell chips believed to be appropriate for the 12-inch Retina MacBook have been available since November, and chips appropriate for the standard MacBook Air began shipping in January.

Along with a Retina display, the 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to come without a fan assembly for silent operation, made possible by the aforementioned Core M chips, and it may also include a revamped trackpad that does not incorporate a mechanical button. It is said to feature smaller bezels in a Retina MacBook Pro-style black, a keyboard that stretches right to the edges of the machine, and speakers that are located above the keyboard.

The Michael Report has a mixed track record when it comes to rumors. The site accurately predicted some design elements of the iPad Air 2, but its predictions may have been based on dummy models that were circulating around the Internet at the time. The site also shared details on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus ahead of their launch, inaccurately calling the iPhone 6 Plus the ""iPhone 6L"" and suggesting the iPhones would come with quad-core processors and sapphire displays.

More details about what Apple plans to unveil at its Monday, March 9 event may come out through the week. Thus far, many sites have agreed that the focal point of the event will be the Apple Watch, with Apple unveiling new details about the device like its price and its official launch date.

"Bloomberg: Apple pushes back 12.9-inch iPad Pro production to September","The 12.9-inch “iPad Pro” that was expected to make its first public appearance around April before being pushed back to Q2 has been postponed yet again, a new Bloomberg report says. The new release date is reportedly some time in September, right around the next-gen iPhone launch.

This delay is said to be the result of display panel supply problems…

The larger tablet is expected to include an A8X processor built by Apple, and is far enough along in the development process that we’re already starting to see leaked molds, supposed manufacturing renders, and even manufacturing schematics that claim the device will run on an A9 chip and cite the name as the “iPad Air Plus.”

Pushing the bigger iPad back to the same time as an iPhone launch makes a lot of sense, especially if both will run on the same A9 processor (as at least one rumor has suggested) or share other features. In fact, Apple hasn’t released an iPad this early in the year since the iPad 3 (“The New iPad”) launched in 2012. The fourth-generation iPad and both models of the iPad Air—as well as all iterations of the iPad mini—have been released near the end of the year.","1"
"Apple to Delay Production of Larger iPads","Apple Inc., which has seen stagnating iPad sales, will delay the start of manufacturing for a larger-screened version of the tablet, people with knowledge of the matter said.

Production of the 12.9-inch-screen iPad is now scheduled to start around September because of delays involving the supply of display panels, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public. Apple had initially planned to begin making the larger version this quarter, people familiar with those plans had said.

A new big-screen tablet is part of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s effort to reinvigorate the iPad product line, where sales have declined for four straight quarters. IPads are also facing competition from larger iPhones, which were introduced in September and helped Apple deliver record profit in the latest quarter.
Apple, based in Cupertino, California, currently sells the iPad with a 9.7-inch display and the iPad mini, which has a 7.9-inch screen. Apple hasn’t disclosed plans for a bigger iPad.

Existing suppliers to Apple include Sharp Corp., Japan Display Inc. and LG Display Co., according to the company’s supplier list. LG Display fell 2.5 percent to a four-month low in Seoul. Sharp fell as much as 2.6 percent before closing 0.9 percent higher in Tokyo while Japan Display dropped 2.1 percent.

Business Tools

A larger iPad could also bolster Cook’s initiative to make Apple’s products more appealing to business users. Apple announced a partnership last year with International Business Machines Corp. to create mobile software for businesses and for IBM to help sell iPads to corporate customers.

Even as consumers shift away from tablets in favor of bigger smartphones, businesses remain a growth opportunity for iPads because the devices can be used for field work and as laptop replacements. In total, global sales of tablets to businesses, institutions and governments are projected to jump to 101 million units in 2018 from 19 million in 2013, according to IHS Technology.

Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn cited the opportunity to boost iPad sales to businesses as one of the key reasons why he thinks Apple shares are undervalued. Improvements to the iPad and the IBM partnership should help boost revenue from the device by 13 percent in each of the next three fiscal years, Icahn wrote in a public letter to Cook last year.","1"
"REPORT: Apple's 12.9-Inch 'iPad Pro' Has Been Delayed","It looks like Apple's 12.9-inch iPad has been delayed.

The heavily rumored large-screen iPad, sometimes referred to as an ""iPad Pro,"" was initially reported to be launching in the first quarter of 2015.

A new report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via Apple Insider) says Apple has faced delays on its 12.9-inch iPad, which will push the launch into the second quarter of 2015.

It's important to note that Kuo has a stellar track record when it comes to Apple, which means this is likely more than just a rumor.

The tablet's delay reportedly stems from the type of display that Apple intends to use in the tablet, which will utilize newer LCD technologies for faster response times and higher color saturation, according to Kuo.

Citing a ""time crunch on component production and assembly,"" Kuo believes the iPad Pro won't enter mass production until the second quarter of 2015, months later than Apple's original plans.","1"
"HBO reportedly in talks to debut $15/month standalone streaming service on Apple TV next month","HBO is reportedly negotiating with Apple to have the Apple TV included as a launch device when the network’s new standalone streaming service launches next month. International Business Times reports Apple has been “aggressive” in pushing to get access to the new service as HBO reportedly plans a launch by mid-April in time for the latest season of hit show Game of Thrones:


 
HBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV one of the launch partners for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month. HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service, called “HBO Now,” ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of “Game of Thrones,” according to sources familiar with their plans.

The much anticipated HBO Now streaming service, first announced back in October, will allow users to access HBO content outside of a subscription from a cable TV provider for the first time.

While the Apple TV already offers an HBO channel, it and many others currently require users to first authenticate with a cable TV account. The new streaming service, according to today’s report, will cost around $15/month when purchased directly from HBO and could arrive as soon as next month. The report adds that Apple could “add a second app for HBO Now,” which would help distinguish the standalone service from the HBO GO apps already available for cable subscribers. 

HBO hasn’t yet announced an official launch date, pricing or device support for the service.","1"
"Report: HBO Now coming to Apple TV next month","HBO plans to launch its stand-alone Net video service next month on Apple TV and other devices, according to the International Business Times.

The news generated a bump in Time Warner  (TWX) stock, pushing it to $83.80. Shares closed at $83.08, down 0.1%, and were down slightly (0.15%) in after-hours trading at $82.96.

Sources familiar with HBO’s plans told IBT that Apple TV was among the devices that the streaming service, to be called HBO Now, would be available on at launch. The price for the service, which like Netflix would not require a pay-TV subscription, would be $15 monthly, sources said.

When contacted, HBO offered this statement: “We know there’s great anticipation around our stand-alone streaming service. And when we have details to share, we will do so.”

Back in October, HBO CEO Richard Plepler said the network planned to debut a stand-alone streaming service in 2015. Various reports, including IBT‘s Wednesday suggest HBO wants service up and running when its series Game of Thrones returns April 12 for its fifth season.

“It is time to remove all barriers to those who want HBO,” he said at the time.

Neither Apple nor MLB Advanced Media, which is reportedly providing the streaming technology for HBO, had comment on the report.","1"
"HBO in talks with Apple to be launch partner for coming web service 'HBO Now'","HBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV one of the launch partners for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month. HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service, called “HBO Now,” ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of “Game of Thrones,” according to sources familiar with their plans.

When it launches, consumers will be able to subscribe to “HBO Now” directly from HBO for the first time, rather than through a cable, satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon. The retail price is expected to be $15 a month when purchased directly from HBO, or about the that consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable, satellite or telco provider.

With “HBO Now,” HBO’s corporate parent, Time Warner Inc., is looking to a whole new generation of distributors for HBO such as Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation, Amazon and others to help market the service to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle. CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online.

HBO’s over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest chink yet in the so-called cable bundle, where consumers are required to buy packages of channels, some of which they may never watch. One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscribers as users opt of cable and opt-in to HBO Now.

But some cable providers, such as Cablevision and Cox Communications, have expressed interest in bundling “HBO Now” with broadband for their own subscribers who don’t get cable TV.

Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV, sources say. Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers, but it may add a second app for HBO Now. Apple has spent the last several years negotiating for the rights to offer their own linear TV package; in the meantime, HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV.

While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now, internally the target is an April launch, in time for the April 12 debut of “Game of Thrones.” That’s an aggressive timeframe for Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is building the back-end along with a new front-end separate from HBO Go. HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last fall's debut of ""Game of Thrones.""

The launch of “HBO Now” will be a milestone for Time Warner’s premium TV channel, which has for most of its 42-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels. The web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners, which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and, later, telcos like Verizon and AT&T.

Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $13 to $18 a month. Most see HBO as a retention device; those that subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers. HBO and Time Warner declined to comment.

At $15 a month, HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix, which ranges from $8 to $12 a month for various levels of service, but cheaper than some were predicting. HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better, more current film library. “It’s a premium product and it will be priced accordingly,” HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February.

HBO’s push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV. It has been met with some resistance from current distributors, such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast, two companies in the midst of a $46 billion merger, according to sources.

But HBO heard the same misgivings from cable when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors. HBO’s strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones; it’s unclear how this will go over with Apple, which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media, including the 99 cent single, more than a decade ago.

Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said in December he saw “cord-cutting” accelerate as pay-TV providers dropped subscribers. U.S. pay TV providers lost 125,000 subscribers in 2014, according to Leichtman Research Group. At the same time, HBO and Cinemax its highest number of new subscribers -- 2.8 million -- in 30 years.

Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go, the service that allows HBO’s TV subscribers to access it on the web, smartphones and tablets. The two services will have separate log-in pages and separate apps, but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion. The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee: HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices; HBO Now for those who don’t subscribe via TV.

"HBO Reportedly in Talks with Apple for Launch of New Unbundled Streaming Service","The new season of Game of Thrones starts next month, and you know what that means: Cue the mad dash to secure someone's HBO Go password in time. But for cord cutters (and cord never-getters) who want to tune in online, this year may mark the first time they've been able to do so without breaking the rules.

HBO is reportedly in talks with Apple to be the launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service that wouldn't require a cable subscription, according to International Business Times. HBO Now, as it's allegedly being called, would cost $15/month and open up access to HBO's film and TV titles to distributors like Apple TV and Roku.

HBO's existing streaming app HBO Go is currently available only through a cable subscription. Last year, HBO announced that it would finally unbundle its streaming services from cable in 2015, and the HBO Now launch could be signals that HBO is making good on that promise.

It's unclear how the HBO Now library would measure up to HBO Go's current offerings, but the companies are reportedly trying to wrap up negotiations in time for the Season 5 premiere of Game of Thrones next month. So it's likely a safe bet that recent HBO content would be available through the Apple service.

At a price point that's double the monthly fee for both Netflix and Hulu, the new service had better deliver on quantity, as both services offer robust streaming libraries of their own. However, while the quality of the content on those services can vary wildly, the HBO brand is known for its acclaimed original series like The Wire, The Sopranos, and Six Feet Under.

Fans of HBO's programming, who increasingly occupy a demographic that's moving away from cable, have long craved a cable-free streaming service—but HBO has deflected the matter for years.

Presumably, the HBO Now launch must navigate the complexities of HBO's longstanding relationship with cable carriers—Time Warner, HBO's parent company, reportedly makes 70% of its profits from cable subscriptions. But if the current negotiations with Apple are successful, the Now service could be HBO's first crack at making good on its promise to cord cutters.","1"

"Report: Apple Watch Will Need Charging Every Day","Amidst all the fist-pumping and Bono-goofing yesterday, one piece of information was conspicuously absent: The Apple Watch's battery life. What's the point of strapping a tiny computer to your body if it needs constant charging? According to Re/code, even Apple hasn't quite figured out the battery dilemma yet.

After Tim Cook mentioned charging Apple Watch ""every night"" on stage, John Paczkowski confirms today that a source within Apple pins the charge-by date at nightly—which would imply that the Apple Watch has a battery life of less than a day. Apparently, Apple is still working to improve that number before release. ""We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging,"" an Apple spokesperson told Paczkowski, seemingly confirming the source.

This isn't just Apple's problem. As a paradigm, smartwatches still have quite a few kinks that need working out before they'll seem truly functional—and battery life is one of the biggest. On Monday, Gizmodo's Brent Rose reported that the Moto 360's battery life, while not as bad as expected, was only about 24 hours.

That's not terrible, but it does present some problems from a user experience perspective. The main selling point of many smartwatches is that they will constantly track your activity, from sleeping to working out. If your device needs to be charged for even a few hours every day, that's lost data, as information designer Nicholas Felton pointed out yesterday on Twitter:

Also sad that the watch charging solution means unbroken health stats are impossible. Not necessary for everyone, but important for many.

— Nicholas Felton (@feltron) September 9, 2014

Sure, not everyone cares about tracking things like REM cycles. Not everyone will mind taking off their watch for a few hours every day. But the ideal use case for Apple Watch, just like a regular watch, is effortless omnipresence. It should just work—and for periods of time longer than 12 hours. [Re/code]","1"
"Code/Red: Apple Watch Battery Life — “Charge Nightly”","One More Thing … You Have to Charge It Every Day

“Bono really should ask Tim Cook about the Apple Watch’s battery life.” I tweeted that yesterday during the U2 frontman’s awkward vaudeville routine with Cook onstage Tuesday at Apple’s biggest event in years. We were clearly moments away from its end and we hadn’t been told how long the company’s first wearable will run on a single charge. Expected battery life was a glaring omission in an otherwise impressive parade of features and specs. And after ignoring it completely during the Apple Watch’s onstage debut, the company stalwartly refused comment on it during the device demos that followed.

There’s a good reason for that. Sources tell me that Apple isn’t yet happy with the watch’s battery life, which isn’t going to break any industry standards. “It’s about a day right now,” said one, adding that Apple is working on various modifications ahead of the device’s 2015 launch to improve it. Reached for comment, Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris declined to provide an estimate on expected battery life, but said the company expects users will charge their Apple Watches once daily. “There’s a lot of new technology packed into Apple Watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day,” Kerris said. “We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging.”

"REPORT: Apple Isn't Happy With The Battery Life Of Its New Smartwatch","On Tuesday, Apple unveiled its first wearable device, the Apple Watch. During the company's presentation, we learned a lot about what you'll be able to do with the company's new smartwatch.

But what we didn't learn, however, is how long its battery would last on a single charge.

That may be because Apple is still working out this detail, as a new report suggests.

Attributing anonymous sources, Re/code's John Paczkowski reports that Apple isn't happy with the watch's battery life just yet. In its current form, the watch's battery life will not break any industry standards, Paczkowski says.

Right now, the Apple Watch's battery life is about one day, but Paczkowski's sources say Apple is working on some modifications to make the watch last longer on a charge before its 2015 launch.

This aligns with what we've heard from Apple as well, since a company representative told us the watch can be charged at night. Apple hasn't offered any further comment on the watch's battery life.

Battery life has been one of the biggest obstacles facing wearable devices. That's because a lot of smartwatches run on components that are meant for smartphones and aren't properly optimized for wrist-worn gadgets, Chris Jones, vice president and principal analyst with Canalys Insight, told Business Insider in a previous interview.

""We're expecting so much from these early products in the market when we don't really have dedicated components to go inside these devices,"" Jones said. ""We're nowhere near seeing the best of what can be developed out there.""

"REPORT: The Apple Watch will be available outside the US when it launches next month","The Apple Watch will reportedly be available in other countries, including Germany, when it launches in April, according to 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman.

Apple CEO Tim Cook shared this information with employees at the company's flagship store in Berlin, according to Gurman, who says he spoke with an Apple employee in attendance.

Specifically, Cook said the watch won't be exclusive to the United States in April.

It's unclear which markets the Apple Watch will be available in, and whether or not it will be released at exactly the same time in multiple markets. As Gurman points out, it's possible Apple could release the Apple Watch in the US before releasing it to international markets such as Germany later in the month.

This is a somewhat unusual move for Apple to make with a first-generation product. Both the iPhone and iPad were available exclusively in the US before expanding to other markets.

Apple has been showing off its watch at boutiques in Paris and in the Paris edition of Vogue, so it seems like the company is making a push to market the watch overseas as well, as Gurman also noted.

We expect to learn more next week when Apple holds its press event on March 9.

"Apple Watch may be available outside US shortly after launch","Lately, Apple cEO has been making the rounds in Europe, stopping at various stores and chatting with employees. Now and then, we get tidbits of info about his chats. The last time we heard anything about his commentary on Apple Watch, it was that he wore it in the shower, suggesting it’s a bit more water resistant than originally thought. Cook also said the Apple Watch was good for a full day of use. Now, he’s saying it will be available outside the US just after launch.

According to unnamed employees, Apple’s CEO says the Apple Watch will be available outside the US in April. Cook reportedly said this to Apple Store employees in Berlin, and said, specifically, that the Apple Watch would come to Germany sometime in early April.

There was no word on if any other countries or regions were specifically mentioned by Cook.

This is another exciting piece to the puzzle for those anticipating big things from Apple on March 9. Though we’ve got quite a bit of insight on Apple Watch, we don’t know it all.

So far, Apple is busy erecting a tent just outside the events hall where they’ll (presumably) give us more details on the Apple Watch next week. Though not necessarily confirmed as an Apple Watch hub, the tent is reminiscent of the outdoor space Apple erected last Fall, when they officially announced their wearable.

Until we know for sure, rumors of Apple Watch coming to more countries than the one I live in is exciting news. In the past, Apple (like most companies) launched stateside before gently rolling their items to other countries. With an expected first-run of 5 million Apple Watches, though, the company might have no reason not to let interested fans slap one on their wrist.

"NYT: Apple Watch includes ‘Power Reserve’ mode, shows only the time but conserves battery life","The New York Times has published a piece about the culmination of the Watch project, as Apple transitions from product development stages to production and marketing to consumers. The piece reiterates that Apple was working on a vast array of health tracking sensors that were later dropped, which 9to5Mac covered extensively at the time.

However, the post includes one new piece of information about a previously-unannounced mode called ‘Power Reserve’. According to the report, users will be to enable a special low-power state that conserves battery life. In this mode, users will be able to see the time but cannot interact with the ‘smarter’ watch features like other apps. It is likely that other power-sapping features, like the constant connection to an iPhone for notifications, will also be disabled in this mode…



 
Apple has said the watch battery is estimated to last a full day, requiring a user to charge it at night, similar to a smartphone. The company also developed a yet-to-be-announced feature called Power Reserve, a mode that will run the watch on low energy but display only the time, according to one employee.

9to5Mac has previously reported that Apple was targeting to achieve approximately 19 hours of average usage time per day, combining in-app functions with standby time, as well as 2.5 hours of straight heavy app usage. According to many reports, improving battery life has been a key goal of development since the Watch’s initial debut in September. It is unclear exactly what battery life was finally attained, but Tim Cook has repeatedly said that the device will need to be charged every night, implying approximately one day of battery life. Apple may offer more specifics at its event on March 9th, where the company will reveal more details about Apple Watch.

One more perhaps humorous tidbit from the NYTimes: Supposedly Apple used specialized cases for the AppleWatch which disguised it as a Samsung watch, though we’re not certain how widespread this was since lots of Apple Watch sightings have happened around Cupertino and elsewhere.","1"
"Apple Watch to reportedly offer 'Power Reserve' to help extend battery life","Apple will offer a low power mode on Apple Watch to help boost it through longer days, according to a new report that also takes a stab at dispelling rumors that the company may have elected to all some long-rumored sensors last minute.

With the exception of Pebble products, most current and upcoming smartwatches - including the Apple Watch - will last no more than a day on a single charge. To help mitigate this issue, Apple has reportedly developed a still unannounced software feature of the Apple Watch called Power Reserve, according to the New York Times. It's said to cut power to all non-essential functions and display only the time, helping to extend the watch's life in cases where a recharge may not be possible. The function is similar in concept to the Battery Saver mode in Android 5.0, which can push smartphone battery life from minutes to hours by reducing processor use.

Apple previously stated that the Watch's battery should last only a normal day, requiring a fresh charge at night. Although standard among smartwatches, the issue has created controversy, since many had been hoping Apple would solve the smartwatch industry's battery woes with its inaugural effort.

The report also notes that despite some recent claims to the contrary, Apple's decision to abandon some advanced health tracking features came over 18 months ago, rather than at the last minute. Early experiments in tracking factors like blood pressure and stress are said to have been ditched after the sensors proved unreliable and otherwise unworkable. Instead, the first-generation device only features motion and heart-rate sensors, once again mirroring some competing smartwatches.

The Times also highlights some of the challenges that faced the Apple Watch's development cycle, noting that Apple not only encountered technical difficulties in achieving its ideal design but was also forced to battle the loss of key engineers, some of whom were poached by Google-owned home automation outfit Nest Labs. Among them was Bryan James, who became an Engineering vice president at Nest early last year.

Chief among some of the later challenges was keeping a tight lid on secrecy surrounding the product while simultaneously deploying evaluation units into the real world, for which Apple engineers created dummy casing, including some resembling Samsung smartwatches.

Apple is due to reveal more details about the Watch at a San Francisco press event on March 9th. AppleInsider will be offering live coverage of the event as it progresses.","1"
"Apple Watch Power Reserve feature will save battery life, report says","In the days leading up to Apple's big event next week, which is rumored to be focused on the Apple Watch, a new detail about the company's first wearable has been leaked.  Along with all other features mentioned during Tim Cook's unveiling of the smartwatch in September, the device will also come with a feature called Power Reserve, according to The New York Times.

The report, which cites an anonymous Apple employee, claims that the unannounced feature will allow the watch operate in a mode that only shows the current time on its display, presumably to preserve battery power for other functions.

A standby mode for a wearable isn't particularly innovative, but given the questions surrounding the battery life of the Apple Watch (about a day, according to Apple), a Power Reserve feature dedicated to preserving battery life could be the device's saving grace. (Particularly when figures like $5,000 are being tossed around the rumor mill as the price for the top tier model.)

Another surprising detail revealed in the report is that during field testing of the Apple Watch, engineers disguised the device with a fake casing to make it look like a Samsung smartwatch. So if you've seen Apple employees walking around with what looks like a Samsung Gear and wondered why, you now have an answer to the mystery.

That last detail will probably come as a surprise to Samsung, a company often accused of following Apple's lead when it comes to mobile devices. But it also highlights the fact that Apple is entering a space already packed with smartwatches, so the success of the Apple Watch isn't a foregone conclusion, solid battery life or not.

"Apple Watch’s Power Reserve feature combats short battery life","The Apple Watch is the most buzzed about wearable to hit the market in a long time, and not all of the buzz is good. We've shared some of th earlier rumblings about the Apple Watch's short battery life. Now we are hearing news of a new feature called Power Reserve, which could be a battery-saving mode that lets the Apple Watch run on low energy while only displaying the time.

The Apple Watch's battery life is expected to only last a day. This puts it at the bottom of the pack for iOS smartwatches. Even with a Power Reserve function, the battery is significantly lagging behind the Pebble Time's seven day battery life. Even before wearables came on the scene, not everyone is diligent about plugging in their smartphones overnight. One of the most frustrating things in the world is a dead battery when you need to check your email, text, or actually make a call.

If the expected battery life is only one day, then we must consider what happens with higher than average usage. Imagine if dynamic and draining apps are engaged, then the battery has the possibility of lasting only until midday. This means that the user will have to take his watch off to charge it.The allure of a wearable is its instant notifications while your phone is tucked away in your pocket. If the Apple Watch isn't on your wrist, will you be drawn to look at the notifications?

Can the new consumers get used to plugging in every night? The Power Reserve feature sounds like it may revert the smartwatch back to an ordinary time piece to save battery life. It's still better than a running out of juice. Without a charge, a dead Apple Watch isn't even a watch. It's just an expensive bracelet. Perhaps the short battery life will be overshadowed by the army of apps and developers Apple has at its disposal. We'll let you know all the emerging details leading up to Apple's big event on March 9th, 2015.

The article also mentions a few details about the behind-closed doors development of the Apple Watch. Amusingly, Apple engineers who've been putting the device through its paces have kept the Apple Watch in a case that makes it look like one of Samsung's Gear smartwatches.

"Sorry, Argentina's President Didn't Actually Adopt a Jewish Werewolf","If you've been anywhere even remotely near a computer today, you've probably heard that Argentina's president recently adopted a young Jewish man to stop him from turning into a werewolf. And why not—it's internet gold! Also, as it turns out, not even remotely true.

According to the Washington Post, the story of the day is as follows:

A tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf — known as ""el lobison"" in Argentina — after his 13th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form, feeding on the dead and murdering all before it.... The fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born, which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing.
While, yes, seventh sons and daughters in Argentina are eligible to become the godson or goddaughter (read: not the adopted child) of the country's president, as The Guardian points out, Jewish werewolf-hood has no part in the tradition. Which is fairly evident from Argentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's tweets depicting the country's newly announced first Jewish godson.

Top translation: They brought me a menorah. They asked me to light it. Bottom translation: I didn't realize it, but their visit coincided with Hanukkah.

But, as The Guardian points out, this nice, totally innocuous event somehow got mixed up with an ancient, werewolf-esque myth called the lobizón:

But somehow, the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón(Argentina's equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.

Evidently, the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colorful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible – confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behavior from national leaders in the continent of magical realism.

In fact, the only connection between the two tales is that they center around seventh children. There is an actual, century-old tradition in which every seventh child born to an Argentinian family is eligible to become the president's godchild—a practice originating from Czarist Russia. The tale of the lobizón, on the other hand, started amongst Argentina's gauchos and has nothing whatsoever to do with the president's newly minted godson.

So sorry to burst your bubble, internet—no werewolf Jewish godsons this time. But hey, at least it got us talking about this again. [The Guardian]

"People Actually Believed Argentina’s President Adopted A Jewish Boy To Stop His Change Into A Werewolf","The story went like this: a young Argentinian man named Yair Tawil just turned 13 years old and was adopted by the country’s president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchhner. Why did she do it? It’s simple really. Due to Argentinian folklore, the president was required to adopt the boy in order to prevent him from turning into a werewolf. At least that’s what people believed. From New York Daily News:

According to tradition in the country, the seventh son born to a family turns into a werewolf, a feared “el lobison”.

The creature only shows its true nature on the first Friday after the boy’s 13th birthday, turning the teenager into a demon at midnight during every full moon.

A demon at midnight? Do tell…

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

Fear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys – an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption, aimed at stopping the deadly stigma. (Via)

The problem here is that all of it is bullsh*t. According to The Guardian, it is a nice mixture of folklore and truth that fooled plenty of people and may have had them running for the silver:

Like all good urban myths, the articles were based on a grain of truth: by tradition, the seventh son (or daughter) born to an Argentine family is eligible to become the godson (or daughter) of the president. Until this month, the honour had only been bestowed on Christian babies, but on Wednesday, Iair Tawil – not a baby, but the strapping 21-year old son of a rabbi – became the country’s first Jewish presidential godson…

[Somehow], the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón (Argentina’s equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.

That makes the entire thing infinitely less appealing. I’m disappointed now, and not just because I was ready to go get The Monster Squad together to test out my “nards” theory. Stupid facts, ruining a good story yet again. I bet science will be coming along shortly, via UBER no doubt, to add in an annoying truth to make werewolves even less cool. F*cking science.","1"
"Argentina's President Didn’t Adopt A Jewish Child To Avoid Becoming A Werewolf; So What Did She Do?","Seems like the President of Argentina Cristina Fernández Kirchner did not exactly save a Jewish boy from becoming a werewolf. Apparently this is what happens when a tradition and an urban legend get intertwined. The tradition does dictate that the seventh child born to an Argentine family with six consecutive children of the same sex is eligible to become the godchild of the president; and the urban myth says this child’s fate is unlucky as it is meant to become a werewolf sooner or later. So technically Lair Tawil was safe.

According to the real legend of the ‘lobizón’ (or werewolf) it is only the seventh son of the seventh son who could be potentially cursed. The Guardian reported Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda said, “The local myth of the ‘lobizón’ is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president.”

The tradition of the president adopting a seventh child began in 1907 when then-president José Figueroa Alcorta, was asked by Russian immigrants Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann to become their son’s godfather. “The couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia, where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons, and Argentina’s president accepted.”

Although Isabel Perón passed the law in 1974, it’s still so that not every seventh child is eligible to become a presidential godchild; the honor is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively, with no daughters in between. The president with most godsons was Juan Perón, who had 1,982 over three terms in office. Kirchner has already become the presidential godmother of almost 700 children since taking office in 2007, and for all we know, she might've saved a few from becoming werewolves.","1"
"Argentine President Takes On Godson — But Not To Keep Werewolf At Bay","Update at 5:38 p.m.

Did Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner take on a godson? Yes. Did she do it, as we and others reported, because of the legend of the werewolf? No.

The Guardian reports that a tradition that began during mass Russian immigration to Argentina in the early 20th century became conflated with a local legend involving seventh sons and werewolves.

""The local myth of the [lobison] is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son [or seventh daughter] born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,"" Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told the newspaper.

The emigres from Russia who asked the Argentine president in 1907 to become the godfather to their seventh son were carrying on a custom from czarist Russia. The practice became law in 1974.

Our original post is below:

Silver bullets are believed to be among the few effective weapons against werewolves. In Argentina, add presidential protection to that short list.

President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, in keeping with a long-standing tradition, has embraced a 21-year-old Jewish man as her godson to prevent him from assuming a lycanthropic form.

The root of the story is the mythology of the Guarani people that says the seventh son in a family of only male children will turn into el lobison — a werewolf. This legend prompted some people to abandon — or kill — their seventh-born sons. So Argentina passed a law in the 1920s that gave the seventh son presidential protection along with a gold medal and a scholarship until his 21st birthday.

At first, that law covered only Catholic families. But in 2009, a presidential decree broadened the law to cover children of other faiths, too.

Kirchner's godson is Yair Tawil, the seventh son of a rabbi, and he's the first Jewish godson of an Argentine president.

The Jewish Telegraphic Agency reports:

Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office in Buenos Aires. They lit Hanukkah candles on a menorah the family presented her. Kirchner publicized the event on Twitter, calling the meeting ""magical"" and the Tawil family ""marvelous.""","1"
"No, Argentina's president did not adopt a Jewish child to stop him turning into a werewolf","Nope. Argentina’s President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has not become godmother of a Jewish baby to stop him from becoming a werewolf – despite what you may have read in multiple news reports.

Over the past few days, the story has been reported and unquestioningly re-reported across the echo chamber of the internet, picked up by news organisations around the world including Haaretz, Buzzfeed, The Independent and The Huffington Post.

Like all good urban myths, the articles were based on a grain of truth: by tradition, the seventh son (or daughter) born to an Argentine family is eligible to become the godson (or daughter) of the president. Until this month, the honour had only been bestowed on Christian babies, but on Wednesday, Iair Tawil – not a baby, but the strapping 21-year old son of a rabbi – became the country’s first Jewish presidential godson.

In her Twitter account, Kirchner described Tawil, 21, as “completely sweet” and lit Hanukkah candles with his family.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

But somehow, the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón (Argentina’s equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.

Evidently, the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colourful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible – confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behaviour from national leaders in the continent of magical realism.

But according to Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda, there is no link between the two traditions. “The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,” he said.

That custom began in 1907, when Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann, Volga German emigrés from south-eastern Russia asked then-president José Figueroa Alcorta to become godfather to their seventh son, said the historian.

“The couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia, where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons, and Argentina’s president accepted.”

The practice soon became tradition and was passed into law in 1974 by Isabel Perón, the widow of Argentina’s political strongman General Juan Perón, once she succeeded him in the presidential seat after his death in office. As Argentina’s first woman president, Mrs Perón extended the benefit to seventh daughters as well.“The unconnected myth of the lobizón began among Argentina’s “gauchos,” the cowboys of Argentina’s vast cattle-raising Pampas, adapted from the older European werewolf legends,” said Balmaceda.In the Argentinian version, the lobizón transforms into a mixture of pig and dog every Tuesday and Friday night – not just once every full moon. Unlikely other werewolves of myth, the lobizón transmits its curse not through its bite but by passing between the legs of its unfortunate victims.

In Catholic Argentina, large familes are not uncommon: over 120,000 families had seven of more children at last count in 2006. Not all qualify to become presidential god-children as the honour is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively, with no daughters in between.

The president with most godsons was Juan Perón, who had 1,982 over three terms in office. He is followed by another Peronist former president, Carlos Menem, who had 1,136 during the 1990s. Fernández has become presidential godmother to some 700 children since taking office in 2007. Earlier this year, she set another precedent, by making the the daughter of a lesbian couple the first presidential godchild.","1"
"This Woman Is Wrongly Being Called A Sexual Predator After Her Private Sex Tape Was Used For A Hoax","A story is currently circulating about a teacher from Santiago del Estero, Argentina, named Lucita Sandoval who allegedly made a sex tape with a 16-year-old student, which then leaked on WhatsApp.

British tabloids like the Daily Mail picked up the story, going so far as to write that there would be a criminal investigation and that this isn’t the first time Sandoval has had sexual relations with a student.

The only issue with all of these sites covering the story of Lucita Sandoval, however, is that almost none of it is true, as Gawker points out.

Local Santiago del Estero newspaper Nuevo Diario debunked the Lucita Sandoval sex tape last week.

The sex tape currently going viral is believed to be a private sex tape that was shared to WhatsApp and then uploaded to streaming porn sites.

To make things weirder, the woman currently misidentified as “Lucita Sandoval” is becoming a celebrity on Facebook and Twitter. A friend of the woman cleared up her identity for Nuevo Diario.

According to her Facebook, the woman is a teacher, but not in Santiago del Estero — she’s from a different city called Corrientes. The man in the video isn’t 16 years old, either. According to his Facebook, he’s in college.

So now, not only is a random woman’s private sex tape going viral, news sites all over the world are accusing her of possibly sexually assaulting a student.

Internet gossip sites incorrectly stated that Miss Sandoval was a teacher and was secretly filmed by a grinning pupil of hers.

It has since emerged that the woman in the video is not Miss Sandoval, but a completely different woman from the city of Corrientes in Argentina.

And reports that she engaged in sexual antics with a school pupil proved to be false too, after it was revealed the young man in the video is a college student.

It was also falsely reported that the 'teacher' has several times faced disciplinary hearings over inappropriate relationships with pupils

An Argentinian newspaper investigated the claims, and found that no such woman exists and the video appears to be a private sex tape that was shared via Whatsapp and then uploaded to a hardcore porn website.","1"
"Lucita Sandoval sex tape hoax: Viral Argentine video features college student ― not 16-year-old boy","The story of English teacher Lucita Sandoval’s affair with a 16-year-old student went viral after video allegedly showing the two having sex leaked. But the video in question is from a porn website, and features a woman and a college student, a local newspaper found.

A salacious sex tape from an Argentinian teacher’s affair with her 16-year-old student is likely nothing more than an Internet hoax.

An Argentinian newspaper debunked the racy story. While the actual tape may be real, it features a woman and a college student ― not a teacher and her pupil, Nuevo Diario reported.

The story of teacher Lucita Sandoval went viral after video allegedly showed the 26-year-old having sex with an underage student from her school in the city of Santiago del Estero. The scandalous story maintained the boy filmed her without her consent and then shared the 23-minute clip with his friends on WhatsApp.

The story rapidly spread throughout Latin America and picked up even more steam when English wire services reported it.

But the woman in the video is not a teacher ― and the “boy” is a college student, the Santiago del Estero newspaper found.

While the tape is real, it appears to be from a porn website.

The real woman who appears in the clip, identified by a friend, is from a different Argentine city, Corrientes, the newspaper reported. She does have a teaching degree, but was not employed at the school in question. The newspaper tracked down the man in the video, too, who is well over the age of 16 and in college.

It’s unclear if “Lucita Sandoval” is a real teacher who was the victim of the online hoax or an entirely made-up person.","1"
"“Axl Rose dead 2014” : Guns N' Roses frontman killed by internet death hoax","News of singer Axl Rose’s death spread quickly earlier this week causing concern among fans across the world. However the December 2014 report has now been confirmed as a complete hoax and just the latest in a string of fake celebrity death reports. Thankfully, Guns N' Roses frontman is alive and well.

UPDATE 03/12/2014 : This story seems to be false. (read more)

Axl Rose death hoax spreads on Facebook

Rumors of the singer’s alleged demise gained traction on Monday after a ‘R.I.P. Axl Rose’ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ‘likes’. Those who read the ‘About’ page were given a believable account of the American singer’s passing:

“At about 11 a.m. ET on Monday (December 01, 2014), our beloved singer Axl Rose passed away. Axl Rose was born on February 6, 1962 in Lafayette. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”
Hundreds of fans immediately started writing their messages of condolence on the Facebook page, expressing their sadness that the talented 52-year-old singer, musician and songwriter was dead. And as usual, Twittersphere was frenzied over the death hoax.

Where as some trusting fans believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report, perhaps learning their lesson from the huge amount of fake death reports emerging about celebrities over recent months. Some pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major American network, indicating that it was a fake report, as the death of a singer of Axl Rose's stature would be major news across networks.

A recent poll conducted for the Celebrity Post shows that a large majority (89%) of respondents think those Axl Rose death rumors are not funny anymore.

Axl Rose Death Hoax Dismissed Since Singer Is ‘Alive And Well’

On Tuesday (December 02) the singer's reps officially confirmed that Axl Rose is not dead. “He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,” they said.

Some fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved singer. Others say this shows his extreme popularity across the globe.","1"
"Axl Rose Dead? Fans Freak Out Over Death Rumors","Rumors, claiming the Guns N’ Roses frontman allegedly died, started spreading online on Dec. 3, leaving fans shocked and saddened. Could it really be true or have Axl Rose fans fallen for a death hoax?
Axl Rose was allegedly found dead in his West Hollywood home at age 52, according to a crazy new report. Could the Guns N’ Roses frontman really have died? Fans seems to be completely shocked — and confused.


Axl Rose Dead — Guns N’ Roses Frontman Dies In West Hollywood Home?
Don’t worry! This report is a hoax. Axl proved he’s not dead by addressing the situation on Twitter a few hours ago.


At least he has a sense of humor about the death rumor!

The fake story came from a site called MSNBC.website.com, which was designed to look like an MSNBC report. However, the two have no connection whatsoever.

The headline from the bogus story reads: “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”

“Unconfirmed reports say Rose was found dead Tuesday late afternoon in his West Hollywood home after police were called around 3:30 pm for a welfare check,” the story claims. The report then goes on to say a police spokesperson said, “The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area.”

The website pulled a similar prank in November, when it claimed Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin had died. That story also proved to be fake!

"The Internet Tried To Make Axl Rose Its Latest Death Hoax Victim","Oh Internet, when will you ever stop killing perfectly healthy celebrities, or at least those that are healthy enough to be alive? Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.

“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.

The awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”

Enough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)

One of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.

"Axl Rose Dies? Guns N’ Roses Singer Dead ‘West Hollywood Home at Age 52′ is Fake","Axl Rose, the singer of Guns N’ Roses, has not died in West Hollywood at the age of 52.

A hoax news website designed to look like MSNBC was promulgating the false rumors this week. The site says MSNBC.website, which isn’t real.

Users on social media were questioning whether the “Chinese Democracy” singer was still alive.

The bogus story reads: “Unconfirmed reports say Rose was found dead Tuesday late afternoon in his West Hollywood home after police were called around 3:30 pm for a welfare check.”

It also includes fake quotes from police officers. The article has been shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook.

MSNBC.website was also responsible for a hoax that said Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin was found dead at age 34 a few weeks ago. That obviously wasn’t true, either.

Earlier his year, Rose said that Guns N’ Roses has two new albums in the works. The last album the band released was “Chinese Democracy” in November 2008, which was censored in China due to its title track and reference to Falun Gong, a traditional Chinese spiritual practice that has been persecuted in China for the past 15 years.

“We recorded a lot of things before ‘Chinese’ was out,” Rose told Rolling Stone.

He added: “We’ve worked more on some of those things and we’ve written a few new things. But basically, we have what I call kind of the second half of Chinese. That’s already recorded. And then we have a remix album made of the songs from Chinese. That’s been done for a while, too. But after Vegas [Guns N’ Roses is performing a residency at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino that runs through June 7], we’re going to start looking very seriously at what we’re doing in that regard.”","1"
"No, Banksy has not been arrested (sigh)","Let’s clear this one up quickly.

A US website is carrying a report that the world’s richest street artist Banksy has been identified and arrested.

It is, of course, completely fake, and the quotes used in the National Report piece were originally ‘issued’ via a press release hosted by a satirical website in 2013.

Hm…","1"
"Everybody Relax, Banksy Wasn’t Arrested And Exposed As A 35-Year-Old Man","If you’ve seen a story floating around on your Facebook feed about Banksy getting arrested and exposed, don’t worry because Banksy is still anonymous and well. The hoax was the work of a “satirical” news site called The National Report — which I’m not linking because f*ck those guys — that makes up fake stories that sound like they could be ostensibly true, usually without a trace of actual satire, as filthy, filthy clickbait. It’s an awful yet unfortunately effective business model.

In a story which was published early this morning, The National Report claimed that Banksy was arrested in London by a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force and revealed to be a 35-year-old man named Paul Horner. The International Business Times did some quick fact checking and exposed the story to be a hoax:

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager’s house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include ‘Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month’ and ‘Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis’, has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

HAHA get it? It’s funny because it’s not true! I guess there’s some logic in there somewhere. It’s not even entertaining to see people share stories that come from places like the The National Report since they’re designed to trick — unlike when dumb people share stories from The Onion, which are designed to actually be satire. Again, and I cannot stress this enough: F*ck those guys.","1"

"Everyone chill! Banksy has NOT been arrested","A hoax report filed by website nationalreport.net claimed the infamous artist had been arrested in London during a raid on his art studio.

The website – which describes itself as ""America's No.1 independent news source"" – said a man named Paul Horner from Liverpool had been nicked.

They even had the cheek to say both the BBC and a representative for Bansky had confirmed the news.

To complete the tale they quoted ""London police chief"" Lyndon Edwards who apparently held a press conference to announce the arrest. A press conference apparently attended by no reporters or TV crews.

HOAX: The false report claiming Banksy had been arrested [NATIONALREPORT]
Most hilariously of all the article was written by one Darius Rubics who has ""won numerous awards for journalism including a Peabody Award and a Pulitzer Prize"".

Despite the ludicrous nature of the article some fell for it hook, line and sinker.

Former Tory MP Louise Mensch, never shy of sharing her opinion with the world, said: ""You have to be kidding me, @metpoliceuk. Banksy?

""There are so many criminals out there, Banksy? The great artist?""

She did later apologise after being duped.


There are so many problems with the hoax we've decided to list some of the best ones for you.

– The article claims Banksy is from Liverpool when all known evidence strongly suggests he is from Bristol.

– Other articles by Darius Rubics include: Dennis Rodman leaves US to talk with leaders of ISIS and Obama declares November national Muslim appreciation month.

– London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards doesn't exist. The top cop in London is Sir Bernard Hogan Howe.

– The article suggests Banksy was nicked in Watford which actually falls under the catchment of the Hertfordshire Police.

– In Britain police do not release mugshots of people after they have been arrested.

– Banksy's PR Jo Brooks, despite apparently being quoted in the original story, has tweeted saying it is a hoax.","1"

"Once Again, The Banksy 'Arrest' Is A Giant Hoax. Repeat: A Hoax.","Banksy has not been arrested. Let's not bury the lede here, people. The news of his incarceration is, yet again, a hoax.

If you woke up this morning to a Twitter feed filled with recycled ""OMG BANKSY WAS ARRESTED/WTF BANKSY WAS NOT ARRESTED"" exclamations, here's why.

This week's fickle rumor started with The National Report, which for those unaware, is an American satire site. A satirical post on the site reported, in a joking fashion lost on many an Internet surfer, that a 35-year-old man had been apprehended by authorities in the London suburb of Watford early Monday morning. It claimed that a press conference had validated that the man was indeed Banksy, that the BBC confirmed the information in their report, and that five men in total had been snagged with counterfeit money and ""future projects of vandalism.""

So illicit! So false.

Just to be extra clear, here are a few things that did not happen today: The anonymous British street artist was not caught by a ""24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force."" Police did not raid his studio in the middle of the night like a carefully plotted drug bust. His name is not and never will be Paul Horner.

We do appreciate the fact that someone out there is trying her hardest to make the name ""Paul Horner"" a thing. Remember last year, when some trolly press release tried to convince the masses that a Banksy arrest happened? The name of the apprehended: Paul Horner.

Stop trying to make ""Paul Horner"" happen, Gretchen. It's not going to happen!","1"

The bogus story alleged the infamous street artist was arrested following a raid on his London studio.

It ‘outs’ him as Paul Horner, a 34-year-old born in Liverpool and says he is being held “without” bail, along with four other, unnamed individuals.

Banksy's publicist Jo Brooks confirmed to the Independent the now viral story is a hoax.

"Hoax 'Banksy Arrested in London' Story Dupes the Internet Again","A hoax story alleging the British graffiti artist Banksy has been arrested and has had his identity revealed has once again duped thousands of people online.

According to the highly refutable website National Report, a 'news' website consisting entirely of fake stories, the artist was arrested by Metropolitan Police at his studio and his identity revealed as 35-year-old Paul Horner, originally from Liverpool.

The article contains all the elements you would expect to see from a news story covering an arrest, including details from police and quotes from those close to Banksy.

However, it only takes the bare minimum of fact-checking and research to spot that this story is a hoax.

The article claims the story has been confirmed by the BBC (it hasn't) and that City of London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy's arrest (he never did and Edwards doesn't even exist).

US news site CNN also did not conduct an interview with Banksy's ""project manager"" John Hawes following his arrest (also because he doesn't exist).

The 'revealed identity' of Banksy is also suspicious.

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager's house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include 'Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month' and 'Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis', has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

One final, major clue that the story is a hoax is that the exact same thing has happened before. Last February, a fake press release that again claimed Banksy has been arrested and again claimed his name is Paul Horner did the rounds, with Jezebel being one of the more high-profile websites to publish the hoax before later taking it down.

Despite this, the latest 'Banksy arrested' story has been shared more than 200,000 times on Facebook and Twitter, proving there are still people who will believe anything they read on the internet.

Sites Complex, Death and Taxes, and Jezebel published online stories stating that Paul Horner, 39, had been identified as the street-artist known as Banksy, and had been arrested by British police in Watford.

Horner is in fact editor of the cunningly-named Super Official News website, where he makes statements such as: “Until then just remember, if it’s on the internet it must be true”, and that “Paul Horner is an American hero.”

Website NationalReport said that “London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards” had held a press conference unmasking Banksy after the arrest - but according to the Met, no such officer exists. However, there is a dairy farmer called Lyndon Edwards.

"Calm down everyone, Banksy hasn't been arrested: 9 clues that it's a hoax","The rumour that Banksy has been arrested has been circulating on the internet

An article has started circulating on Twitter today claiming that Banksy has been arrested.

The story on ""news"" website National Report says that Banksy was arrested in Watford after been tracked by a ""24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force"".

Stories crop up all the time claiming to reveal the true identity of the guerrilla graffiti artist, but this one is particularly ridiculous.

The National Report have also produced this video which claims to prove his arrest.

Video loading

Here's why it's definitely a hoax...

1. Banksy isn't from Liverpool

He's from Bristol according to his Wikipedia.

2. There's no London Police force

There's the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police, both used interchangeably in the article.

3. There's no London Police Chief called Lyndon Edwards

We call them The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. And he is Sir Bernard Hogan Howe.

4. Police don't release pictures of people being arrested

Nope. They definitely don't do that.

5. Met Police don't cover the Watford area.

That's Hertfordshire Police's job.

6. The website it comes from is full of spurious stories

Other headlines on the site include 'Kanye West applies for refugee status' and 'Miley Cyrus replaced by double in 2010'.

7. The same article was circulating last year as a press release

Before Banksy was Paul William Horner a 39 year old, rather than Paul Horner, a 35-year old.

8. The picture of him being arrested is from Notting Hill Carnival 2012

Put that picture URL into Google images and you get pictures from Carnival.

9. And as if you needed any more proof, Banksy's PR has confirmed it is a hoax

@JDBeauvallet it's a hoax— jo brooks (@brightonseagull) October 20, 2014

Nevertheless it looked real enough to fool many people - including former Tory MP Louise Mensch.

You have to be kidding me, @metpoliceuk. Banksy? There are so many criminals out there, Banksy? The great artist?— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) October 20, 2014

But it's definitely a hoax, Banksy's secret is still safe for now. Everyone back in your boxes until the next rumour appears.

Banksy’s real identity has been a closely kept secret ever since his work emerged in 1992.

Initially it was rumoured he was born Robin Banks, a former butcher.

However, more recently people believe he could be Robin Gunningham, who enjoyed a middle-class upbringing in Bristol.

During a rare interview he was described as “a cross of Jimmy Nail and British rapper Mike Skinner”.

Banksy has also claimed his parents think he is a painter and decorator.

"Banksy arrest hoax: US website claims street artist caught in Watford","A hoax story about street artist Banksy being arrested in Watford has duped internet users.

US website National Report alleged the Metropolitan Police had held the elusive graffiti artist after he was traced by a ""24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force"".

It claimed his art studio in the capital had been raided and “thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism” found.

The story also said documents identified the anonymous artist as 35-year-old Paul Homer, from Liverpool.

He was said to be in custody “without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting”.

However, Scotland Yard confirmed the story - which left Banksy's name trending on Twitter - was fake.

A spokesman said: ""We are certainly not aware of Banksy being arrested in Watford, or anywhere else for that matter.""

The story hit a chord with Louise Mensch, the former Conservative MP who is active on Twitter.

She fell for the scam and criticised the Metropolitan Police for not focusing on the ""so many other criminals out there"".

But she quickly apologised when she was alerted to the story being a prank.

The story fooled thousands of others on social media, who expressed shock that the infamous artist had been unmasked at last.

"No, that broken pencil illustration isn't by Banksy","You may have seen a clever Banksy illustration of broken pencils being shared far and wide on social media yesterday. It's a powerful message about optimism and rebuilding after facing adversity. But it's not by Banksy.

The illustration is actually by Lucille Clerc, a London-based illustrator. After being posted on an Instagram account purporting to be associated with Banksy, the image has been shared over 130,000 times. There are a lot of fake Banksy accounts on social media but the one that scraped Lucille Clerc's image has over a million followers, which explains its wide reach.

The Independent talked to a spokesperson from Banksy's camp who said ""We can confirm this is not by Banksy."" [Emergent]","1"
"Lucille Clerc's powerful message of perseverance goes viral after a fake Banksy account reposts it","UPDATE, Jan. 8, 8:51 a.m. ET: We now know that the illustration below wasn't by Banksy and was not an original piece of art. It was illustrated by Lucille Clerc, a London-based graphic designer and printmaker, who shared it on social media on Wednesday night.

Editors' note: This image, which is unique according to a reverse image search done on Tin Eye, was posted on the @Banksy Instagram account to its nearly 1 million followers. It is not, however, confirmed to be an official account operated by the artist. It could be Banksy, but the artist's real accounts are unclear. We've changed the headline and story below to reflect that.

A popular Banksy Instagram account weighed in on Wednesday with a powerful homage to the murdered journalists at the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo, victims of a horrific terror attack.

Take a look:

A photo posted by Banksy (@banksy) on Jan 1, 2015 at 3:02pm PST

The account, which has nearly one million followers — though it is not known to be an official Banksy Instagram account — posted a picture on featuring three pencils — the pencil fully intact is next to the word ""yesterday,"" a broken pencil represents ""today,"" and the resharpened shard shows there will be two pencils ""tomorrow.""

It adds: ""RIP,"" joining scores of other cartoonists and artists who have been sharing tributes throughout the day.

Twelve people were killed in what France's president called a ""terror attack"" on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday, leading authorities to launch a massive manhunt for the gunmen, who remain at large. No arrests have been confirmed in the hunt for the attackers, though an ""anti-terror raid"" is reportedly underway in the northeastern city of Reims.

The brothers, caught on tape by an eyewitness, shouted ""Allahu akbar!"" as they walked outside the building carrying large guns and dressed entirely in black. The magazine staff was in an editorial meeting, around lunchtime in Paris, when the gunmen opened fire. Eleven others were wounded; four of those injuries are serious.

Witnesses described the gunmen as speaking perfect French.

Charlie Hebdo has frequently drawn condemnation from Muslims. In 2011, the magazine was firebombed after it ran a cartoon depicting the Prophet Muḥammad.

The editor in charge of the paper was one of those killed on Wednesday. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, though supporters of militant groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda praised the attack online. World leaders condemned it as an attack on freedom of expression.

"The Image That Everyone Is Sharing By 'Banksy' Isn't By Banksy — But It's Awesome","There's an illustration being shared on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter that claims to be a tribute created by street artist Banksy in response to the terrorist attack that killed 12 people near the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris earlier today.

While the image does have a touching message, it's almost certainly a fake - not created by Banksy.

Here's the illustration that everyone is sharing:

Mashable is reporting that the image was posted by a ""popular 'Banksy' account"" on Instagram. The instagram.com/banksy Instagram isn't run by Banksy at all, and is actually a fan page that shares street art created by a variety of different artists - rarely with any attribution.

Search on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and you'll see plenty of popular accounts that seem to be official Banksy pages. The problem of fake social media accounts is so widespread that Banksy has even posted on his official website to deny he runs any Facebook or Twitter accounts. He does, however, have one Instagram account, which was used during his recent trip to New York.

Facebook was recently forced to remove the verification checkmark for a Facebook page for a Banksy account with millions of Likes after the artists PR representative denied that he had anything to do with it.

The Instagram account that the pencil illustration originates from is part of a ring of fake social media profiles. As well as the fake Instagram and Facebook accounts, the administrators behind the Banksy pages also run a YouTube account that re-uploads popular viral videos to capitalize on their popularity.

Here's an example of a video posted by the fake Banksy YouTube account:

Another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size. The image uploaded to the fake Banksy social media posts is pixelated and low-resolution. Banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work, he wouldn't want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad.

It's tricky to verify new Banksy work. Because of Banksy's continued anonymity, and the often confusing similarity to other graffiti artists, many works of art end up mistakenly labeled as created by Banksy. A handful of galleries and companies in the UK are, however, experts in his work, meaning that they can verify prints purported to originate from Banksy.

Nevertheless, given today's tragic events, the sentiment is strong.

"No, Banksy Didn't Create That 'Charlie Hebdo' Tribute Cartoon, But That Doesn't Mean You Can't Appreciate It","Following the deadly shootings at Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine with a history of lampooning religious extremism, cartoonists came out in droves to support those who were killed Wednesday in the best way they knew how: with their own set of tribute cartoons. Artists from The Independent, The Washington Post, and more published visual depictions of their reaction to the news of the attack, which took the lives of 12 people, a death toll that included four prominent cartoonists. (Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier was perhaps the most high-profile of those killed Wednesday.) And — for those who flocked to Facebook, Instagram, and other forms of social media Wednesday — it appeared that Banksy had dedicated his own cartoon to the tragedy. But, come Wednesday night, fans of the elusive street artist would be disappointed to learn that, no, Banksy likely did not draw the stunning pencil image.  

Though it at first appeared as though the artist was responsible for the cartoon after it surfaced on a Banksy Instagram account, it’s believed that the account does not belong to Banksy himself. Not only because Banksy’s official website insists that the artist keeps off social media — specifically referencing his lack of a Facebook or Twitter account (this short-lived Instagram was the only account that was ever linked to Banksy) — but also, as Business Insider notes, the cartoon image is far too low-res for an artist with Banksy’s notoriety. Writes the site:

Another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size. The image uploaded to the fake Banksy social media posts is pixelated and low-resolution. Banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work, he wouldn’t want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad.
That said, the image itself is striking, and a fitting tribute to those who have passed on following the shootings in Paris. So, though it’s possible Banksy did not design the cartoon (and only leaves you wondering what kind of tribute Banksy would publish), it’s worth digesting, appreciating, and using it to remember that violence will never quell freedom of speech.","1"

Both posts carried only the message ""RIP"".

banksy paris charlie hebdo

The image quickly went viral, but many have since expressed skepticism about whether Banksy is really behind the image.

The page the drawing was shared from was initially verified by Facebook, but that verification was removed in early 2014. Banksy's publicist Jo Brooks told Animal New York that the page is ""100 per cent fake"" and the artist's website says Banksy is ""not on Facebook and has never used Twitter.""

Some have speculated, however, that the denials are all part of cultivating Banksy's puzzling persona.

The Guardian and Mashable both identified the Instagram post as being authentic, but Mashable later updated its story to reflect doubts about the image's provenance.

Business Insider points out that @Banksy Instagram account shares work by other artists, often without attribution. In 2013, The New York Times identified a different Instagram account as being linked to the artist.

Many users on Twitter noticed that similar pictures by different artists were shared before the ""Banksy"" posts.

"Banksy's illustrated response to the Charlie Hebdo attack isn't by Banksy. But it is striking","The artist posted a poignant image in the wake of the shooting that killed 12 at the offices of the French satirical magazine in Paris yesterday

Thousands of Banksy fans have shared this strong pictorial response to the terror attack at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

Masked gunmen stormed the offices in Paris, claiming the lives of 12 and leaving five more seriously injured, yesterday.

Among the dead were four of France’s most celebrated political cartoonists, Jean Cabu, Stephane “Charb” Charbonnier, Bernard “Tignous” Verlhac and Bernard Maris.

The following image was posted via this Instagram yesterday, which has since been shared by over 100,000 people:

His reaction follows that of Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, who released this statement.

“Very little seems funny today,” he concluded.

Gerard Biard, Charlie Hebdo’s editor-in-chief, who was in London at the time of the attack, said: “I don’t understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons. A newspaper is not a weapon of war.”

Barack Obama, David Cameron and Angela Merkel have all condemned the “barbaric” killings and vowed to stand up for freedom of expression.

Seven of the gunmen suspected of being involved in the attack have since been arrested. An 18-year-old accomplice also handed themself in to a police station.

Charlie Hebdo was firebombed in 2011 after they published a spoof issue “guest edited” by the Prophet Mohamed.

The magazine has been threatened on numerous occasions for publishing the religious cartoon caricatures.","1"

This is irrelevant, I don't want it to turn into polemic and distract people from the real issues.

There are way more important things to talk about at the moment, and in the end what matters is that this image speaks to people, so the more it spreads the better it is.

My drawing was a spontaneous reaction, I didn't expect it would have such an echo. Ideas don't break, ideas don't die. Charlie became immortal yesterday and I hope that this terrible day will make us cherish and protect our freedom with even more wit and humour. I can only hope it will inspire people to use their pencils too and that there will be thousands of drawings like this very soon.

"Detroit Police Issue Statement That The Batmobile Is Safe","Earlier today, the Detroit media reported on rumors that the Batmobile had been stolen from the Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice set. It turns out that the rumors were just as absurd as they sounded.

The ironic part is that the unfounded rumors actually triggered a real police investigation. After receiving inquiries from the Detroit media, the Detroit police department contacted producers of Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice to inquire if the Batmobile had indeed been stolen.

According to the Detroit Free Press, Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody issued the statement, “The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs.”

And for those that might claim any type of police cover-up in regards to the theft of the Batmobile, the Detroit Free Press also confirmed with sources close to the production that the Ben Affleck’s ride had not been stolen.

"Zack Snyder Makes Fun of Stolen Batmobile Rumor with New Image","In case you hadn’t heard, a little movie called Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is currently filming in and around Detroit, MI. Since we live in the Golden Age of social media networking, set pictures and videos have fueled all kinds of speculation on what’s going on in this movie, from Ben Affleck’s shoulder injury to Jesse Eisenberg’s hair to Scoot McNairy’s legs.
The most recent set leaks revolved around Batman’s ride. Instagram users posted several pictures of the new, updated Batmobile, which was promptly followed by an official photo released by director Zack Snyder. The exciting design appears to be something of a hybrid between the tank-like vehicle used in Christopher Nolan’s Bat-films and more traditional, hot rod-inspired Batmobiles of old.

Meanwhile, outlets like Bleeding Cool reported a rumor that one of the Batmobiles from the movie’s set had been stolen. The rumor was picked up by some of the mainstream media (such as the local Detroit CBS affiliate) before being debunked by the Detroit Free Press.

In response, director Zack Snyder took to Twitter (as he does) to send up not only the stolen-Batmobile rumor, but to reference a competing franchise. Snyder tweeted the following picture:
Is Snyder taking a sly, friendly dig at J.J. Abrams and the currently-filming Star Wars: Episode VII? It would seem so, but what if Snyder had used, say, a Joker or Two-Face lookalike – or at least one of their henchmen? The internet would’ve imploded. This way, Snyder provides fans with a harmless bit of franchise-crossover in the form of this officially-sanctioned bit of fan-fiction. The attention to detail is pretty funny, too – the way the Gotham PD cop nearest the Batmobile is looking at the Stormtrooper’s blaster is priceless.

Make no mistake, Zack Snyder is following the online fan chatter. He’s not above calling in to a Detroit radio show to defend Aquaman’s badassery and, apparently, will comment on your Instagram video when the mood takes him.

CBM caught Snyder’s now-deleted comment - “Watching you” - on the following video taken by IG user @danielblane, who was home one night while the Batmobile did burnouts on the neighboring Batman v Superman set:
Snyder, whose Instagram handle is @cruelfilms, has removed his comment, but judging by the reaction of the video’s other commenters, the fact that Snyder has weighed in at all delights them to no end.

The fact that the director takes the time to interact with his fans is genuinely heartening for audience members who may have questioned the decision to hand Snyder not just an all-new Superman and Batman, but Warner Bros. and DC’s own interconnected movie universe.

The leaked BvS set pictures and videos still don’t answer any of the bigger questions about the film’s plot and whether or not it will be able to seamlessly integrate multiple superheroes while giving us a satisfying first-time team-up of the World’s Finest, but that won’t stop us from poring over every image from Detroit that we can get our hands on.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will open in theaters on March 25, 2016.

"At CBS Detroit, Fan Site 'Scuttlebutt' Is Enough to Report False Batmobile Theft","Update: Saturday, 12:15 a.m.: Detroit Police say the Batmobile film vehicle was not stolen, the Detroit Free Press reports.
Friday evening article:

Holy crap, Batman -- look what happened to a a once-distinguished news organization.

The CBS Detroit broadcast group's website posts a 10-paragraph article, if that's the right word, about something that may or may not have happened:

A website is reporting that the Batmobile, from the upcoming Batman v. Superman flick, has gone missing in Detroit and is presumed stolen.  

Sounds serious and dramatic. And yet no other local media outlet has a word about it. 

Further reading suggests why.

""Presumed stolen"" refers to a presumption by the anonymous writer of a four-sentence post by Rich Johnston at Bleeding Cool, an Illinois site for comic book fans. Its brief item begins:

The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen. 

That site adds: ""Warner Bros representatives did not respond to inquiries.""


This spectator shot of one Batmobile in Detroit was postedthis week at the website cosmicbooknews.com.
The CBS Detroit writer, Evan Jankens, also makes a nod to verification:

Our brother station WWJ put a call into the Detroit Police Department to see if there is any truth to this. (Update! As of 4 p.m., police were saying they hadn’t heard about this, but were looking into it).

Members of the broadcast group are WWJ-TV (Channel 62), WWJ Newsradio 950 and two sports radio stations.

Absent any confirmation, Jankens riffs speculatively on the notion of a possible Batmobile-jacking:

If this is true I could only imagine seeing it driving down 696 in rush hour.
Seriously, how the heck could someone steal this car? . . . No, it’s the BATMOBILE! It has machine guns in the front.
Does this person — if the rumor is true (we don’t know how credible the source is) — think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?
Hey, we like Friday afternoon playfulness as much as the next keyboard jockey, but stay on the other side of publishing a story from someone else's anonymous source that requires disclaimers such as ""if the rumor is true"" and ""we don't know how credible the source is.""

That wouldn't slide past a high school student publication adviser and it seems like a disservice to readers of CBS Detroit, which didn't share the wispy piece on its Facebook pages and presumably not on its newscasts.

The contrasting tweets below show two approaches to the Bleeding Cool short. The first was sent by CBS Detroit's writer to the film director after publication, while the second was posted instead of a preliminary article.

"Batmobile stolen in Detroit? Good one, joker!","Holy Motor City gossip! The rumored theft of the Batmobile in Detroit appears to be a false alarm.

Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody said that police confirmed with producers of “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” that the vehicle has not been stolen, a rumor that proliferated on the web and social media on Friday.

“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.

Sources close to the production being filmed in metro Detroit also said it wasn’t true that the Caped Crusader’s ride had been stolen.

Buzz about the supposed theft swirled Friday when at least one comic book website reported on the “scuttlebutt” that one of the Batmobile models had disappeared and was presumed stolen.

The rumor was greeted and retweeted with smirking skepticism by some — and insert-your-own-Detroit-joke comments by others.

The Warner Bros. production has been working hard to keep its activities under wraps while filming in and around Detroit. But that’s not always easy when the cast and crew leaves the relative lockdown of the film’s headquarters at Pontiac’s Michigan Motion Picture Studios.

Unauthorized photos of the Batmobile have been hitting the Web this week – an unwelcome reality for studios in a world where everyone with a smartphone is a potential paparazzi. Director Zack Snyder also tweeted an official photo.

And to add some more fun to this, director Zack Snyder tweeted a photo of the culprit. Hint: Snyder is currently in a twitter war with this movie. Hit the jump to check it out.
So there you have it, it was nothing more than a publicity stunt created by social media. It also a great way to market both films, but more importantly we get to see more of the Batmobile.
Now it’s Bad Robot or Disney’s move. The rivalry all started back last July when Snyder tweeted a shot of Superman (Henry Cavill) donning a Sith robe while wielding a red lightsaber. The director added the #superjedi to rub some salt on the wound.

Thankfully it was all just a rumor, but the story did give Batman v Superman director Zack Snyder a reason to pull together some of the minor resources at his disposal for a great photo op. 

Bleeding Cool had the original rumor, and also hilariously scolded CBS for picking up the story. In an update, the site even praised the Detroit Free Press for killing the story BC created in the first place. The DFP reports:

Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody said that police confirmed with producers of “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” that the vehicle has not been stolen, a rumor that proliferated on the web and social media on Friday.

“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.

So the Batmobile isn’t stolen; it hasn’t even lost a wheel. All is right in the world, except for the fact that Bats and Supes are fighting again.

All of which brings us to Zack Snyder’s most recent tweet.
This is the latest in a set of back and forth tweets between Snyder and Bad Robot that play around with the DC and Star Wars characters. A couple more are below.","1"
"Zack Snyder Responds to Fake Stolen Batmobile Report","A recent report from Cosmic Book News stated that the recently revealed Batmobile had been stolen from the Detroit set of ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.""

Not suprisingly, the story turned out to be completely fake. This is also the same site that posted the fake news story earlier this year that ""Breaking Bad"" actor Bryan Cranston had been confirmed in the role of Lex Luthor.

In response to the fake article and seeing an opporunity for another crossover image between his film and J.J. Abrams' ""Star Wars"" movie, director Zack Snyder has posted the following mash-up of the new Batmobile and a Stormtrooper from ""Star Wars"" being arrested by Gotham City cops for stealing the vehicle:","1"
"BATMOBILE NOT STOLEN, MTV CONTEST PRIZE REMAINS UNCLAIMED","Source: Detroit Free Press

Yesterday, we reported on a rumor from Bleeding Cool that someone in Detroit had stolen one of the Batmobiles being used for filming in the city. The rumor took off all over the web, even making its way to Detroit's local CBS affliate. Our article did pretty well, probably because we found that sweet MTV contest video from 1989, showing this plot has been in motion for twenty-five years.

But there's just one problem... it didn't happen. The Detroit Free press checked with police spokesman Michael Woody, who said, ""The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs."" He then exited the room and promptly removed a rubber mask, revealing himself to be The Joker in disguise, and laughed maniacally.","1"
"Batmobile wasn't stolen: Cops","Rumours that the Caped Crusader's ride has been stolen have been greatly exaggerated.

On Friday, bleedingcool.com said, ""The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen.""

Not surprisingly, the Internet went into a tizzy, but later that day, Detroit police said the theft was a rumour.

Sgt. Michael Woody told the Detroit Free Press that police confirmed with producers of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice that the vehicle has not been stolen.

“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.

The paper also said that sources close to the movie being filmed in D-Town also said the fly ride had not been stolen.

Unauthorized photos of the Batmobile appeared online this week, and director Zack Snyder tweeted an official photo on Wednesday.

Batman v. Superman stars Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill, and is scheduled to open in theatres in 2016.","1"
"Boston.com retracts claim about racist email from professor","The tale of the Harvard Business School professor who flipped out because he’d been overcharged $4 by a Chinese restaurant took an ugly turn Wednesday night. The Boston Globe’s free Boston.com site, which first reported the story, posted a follow-up claiming that Ben Edelman had sent a racist email to the restaurant owner — and then replaced the follow-up with an “Editor’s Note,” explaining that the authenticity of the email couldn’t be verified. The Boston Herald has a summary of what went wrong.

The original story about Edelman, by Boston.com’s Hilary Sargent, had gone viral. Who, after all, can resist reading about a privileged Harvard professor threatening legal action against a hard-working business owner because the prices on his website hadn’t been updated for a while? So when Boston.com retracted its explosive allegation (carrying Sargent and Roberto Scalese’s bylines) that Edelman was not just a contentious jerk but a racist, Twitter exploded.


So what did Boston.com publish? It wasn’t long before screen grabs started to make their way around the intertubes. J. Alain Ferry posted a copy here. What happened was that after Edelman apologized to Ran Duan, whose family owns the Sichuan Garden restaurant in Brookline, someone claiming to be Edelman sent another email to the restaurant owner, writing, “You may have won the battle Duan, but at least we can agree your menu is a little less slanty-eyed.” That’s followed up by an apology for accidentally sending what was meant as a private joke, which has the effect of making the mail seem more authentic.

Edelman’s domain name, benedelman.org, is easily found on the Web, and it’s not difficult to send an email using any address you like. The Sichuan Garden website offers an email form that lets you do exactly that. One clue is that all of the legitimate emails Boston.com has posted from Edelman are marked as coming from “Ben Edelman,” whereas the racist email and subsequent apology were from “ben@benedelman.org.”

Despite the retraction, Boston.com as of this moment is still all-in on the rest of its Edelman package. We’ll see what, if anything, comes next.","1"

"Jeff Bezos Is Planning To Make The Washington Post Pre-Loaded On Every Kindle HDX","Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has a plan to boost the readership of The Washington Post, which he bought last year for $250 million.

Amazon's newest line of high-end Kindle Fire HDX tablets will come pre-installed with an app curating Post news and photography, Brad Stone reports for Bloomberg.

The app will be free, at least at first, and will also be available to download on other devices, though with a monthly subscription fee.

The effort is reportedly called ""Project Rainbow"" internally, and marks Bezos' first move to create ties between the newspaper and Amazon.

The initiative is being led by the former editor in chief of Salon, Kerry Lauerman, who was one of many new hires brought on since Bezos took charge.

As Stone points out, this move would not only get the Post to more readers, but also potentially make the Kindle Fire HDX tablet more attractive to buyers. Amazon has made a huge bet on original content, like television shows and video games, to add value to its devices through its subscription service, Amazon Prime, and adding Washington Post's news could align with those efforts.

Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

"Beast-eater, frightened phone signal, threw the victim and rend in the taiga","Reports of more attacks in Yakutia bears on people 53-year-old Igor Nerungri Vorozhbitsyn ignored, they say, for his life more than once met nose to nose with clumsy and all circuits. So as usual without fear went fishing in the nearby Aldan region. From the road, a man went to the creek to winter quarters where usually stayed fishing. Weapons of a knife on his belt in his hands - rods, behind - the backpack.
To rain at times forced to throw a tight long cloak. A few kilometers left on the old highway. Pereobulsya, Bolotnikov tied to a backpack and walked toward the key Evota to zymes.
Coming in a somewhat macabre silence about three hundred meters, clearly felt that the rear - risk. At the same moment a powerful blow to the backpack knocked him down. Falling, he saw a couple of meters of a huge bear.
Igor himself considerable size, weight under one hundred pounds. But pounce beast with incredible force began to throw it as a toy. Poor fisherman tried to pull a knife, but the bitten hand predator is not obeyed, hanging whip.
What happened next, other than a miracle not to name. Bear attacks in the final chord in the chest and grabbed at the moment mobile fisherman made a sound.
- In the taiga time looked - it was 8:30 pm and put a mobile phone in his breast pocket - recalls that terrible battle Vorozhbitsyn. - I have an older model. Push the first button and the machine tells you how many times. When the bear sank his teeth into my chest and bit this button. ""Eight forty. Forty eight ... ""- said in a metallic voice my machine. Beast scared and ran away.
Still not really understanding what had happened, and waiting for a new attack, Igor few minutes lying on the ground. Everything is quiet. Rose. Oh, the horror! Bear almost took the scalp and the skin on the left side of the face, left deep lacerations on his stomach and chest, broke a vein in his right hand - there was gushing blood. How could, hand tied it with rags, but blood continued to ooze. Wounded and bleeding, being careful of the new bear attack, he moved for some reason in the opposite direction from winter quarters and soon completely lost. Night fell on the taiga. Escaping from the rain, cover the broken beast cloak. Very sick and dizzy. Somehow I pulled out his match. Tried to start a fire, but fingers did not obey. Suddenly spurted from the wound and the blood flooded matches.
Spent the night under a tree, listening to every rustle. At dawn, he went on. When the forces finally left, lay down on the ground and crawled. Sometimes got up and staggered moved on. When before the next overnight lay down to rest, suddenly, not believing himself felt the smoke of a fire ...
Two fishermen from Neryungri standing camp here, just picked up on the hands of out-of-darkness bloody Igor. Without delay, immediately put the wounded man in the car and rushed to the nearest village Khatymov. From there, the ambulance - Neryungri. Four hours of operation, and three surgeons literally collected on parched face bloodied pieces Igor. Then - three operations already in the Republican Hospital in Yakutsk. Fortunately, the fisherman left eye was saved. Igor saved and that the first shot hit on the head is not (bear paw easily cut out the skull), and a backpack. Played a protective role and dense coat. Bear claws and teeth left serious wounds on his stomach and chest fisherman. But by a happy coincidence did not touch the internal organs and even ribs broken. And if not for mobile ...

 Bear claws and teeth left serious wounds on his stomach and chest fisherman. 
While doctors saved Igor Vorozhbitsyna hunters looking for a bear attacked him. Evoty literally combed the neighborhood with dogs. And on July 26 shot clumsy 2-3 years old. However, within a few kilometers hunters found more traces of bears. So what killed a man-eating beast or not, no one really can not tell.","1"
"Рыбака от медведя спас мобильник","Сообщения об участившихся в Якутии нападениях медведей на людей 53-летний житель Нерюнгри Игорь Ворожбицын проигнорировал, мол, за свою жизнь не раз встречался нос к носу с косолапыми и все обходилось. Поэтому как обычно без опаски отправился на рыбалку в соседний Алданский район. От дороги мужчина пошел по ручью, к зимовью, где обычно останавливался на рыбалку. Из оружия только нож на поясе, в руках – удочки, за спиной – рюкзак.

Временами накрапывающий дождь заставил набросить плотный длинный плащ. Через несколько километров вышел на старую автомобильную дорогу. Переобулся, привязал болотники к рюкзаку и пошел в сторону ключа Эвота, к зимовью.

Пройдя в какой-то жутковатой полной тишине метров триста, ясно почувствовал, что сзади - опасность. В ту же секунду мощный удар по рюкзаку сбил его с ног. Падая, увидел в паре метров огромного медведя.

Игорь и сам немалых размеров, вес под сто килограммов. Но набросившийся зверь с неимоверной силой начал бросать его как игрушку. Бедный рыбак попытался вытащить нож, но прокушенная хищником рука абсолютно не слушалась, болталась плетью.

То, что случилось дальше, иначе как чудом не назвать. Медведь в финальном аккорде нападения вцепился в грудь и в этот момент мобильник рыбака издал звук.

- В тайге посмотрел время – было 8.30 вечера, и положил мобильник в нагрудный карман, - вспоминает ту жуткую схватку Ворожбицын. - У меня старая модель. Нажимаешь первую кнопку, и аппарат говорит, сколько времени. Когда медведь вцепился зубами мне в грудь и прикусил эту кнопку. «Восемь сорок. Восемь сорок...», - сказал металлическим голосом мой аппарат. Зверь испугался и убежал.

Еще толком не понимая, что произошло, и ожидая нового нападения, Игорь несколько минут лежал на земле. Все тихо. Поднялся. О, ужас! Медведь практически снял скальп и кожу с левой стороны лица, оставил глубокие рваные раны на животе и груди, порвал вену на правой руке - оттуда хлестала кровь. Как смог, перетянул руку тряпками, но кровь продолжала сочиться. Израненный, окровавленный, остерегаясь нового нападения медведя, он двинулся почему-то в обратную сторону от зимовья и вскоре окончательно заблудился. На тайгу опускалась ночь. Спасаясь от дождя, прикрывался разорванным зверем плащом. Сильно болела и кружилась голова. Кое-как достал из кармана спички. Попытался разжечь костер, но пальцы не слушались. Из раны вдруг брызнула кровь и залила спички.

Ночь провел под деревом, прислушиваясь к каждому шороху. Когда рассвело, пошел дальше. Когда силы окончательно покидали, ложился на землю и полз. Иногда вставал и, шатаясь, шел дальше. Когда перед очередным ночлегом прилег отдохнуть, вдруг, не веря себе, почувствовал дым костра...

Два рыбака из Нерюнгри, стоявшие здесь лагерем, буквально подхватили на руки вышедшего из тьмы окровавленного Игоря. Не мешкая, мужчины немедленно посадили раненого в машину и помчались в ближайшее село Хатымь. Оттуда, на скорой – в Нерюнгри. Четыре часа операции, и трое хирургов буквально собрали по запекшимся окровавленным кусочкам лицо Игоря. Потом – еще три операции, уже в республиканской больнице в Якутске. К счастью, левый глаз рыбака удалось сохранить. Игоря спасло и то, что первый удар пришелся не на голову (медведь лапой без труда раскраивает череп), а по рюкзаку. Сыграл свою защитную роль и плотный плащ. Медвежьи когти и зубы оставили серьезные раны на животе и груди рыбака. Но по счастливому стечению обстоятельств не задели внутренние органы и даже не переломали ребра. И если бы не мобильник...

Пока медики спасали Игоря Ворожбицына, охотники искали напавшего на него медведя. Окрестности Эвоты буквально прочесали с собаками. И 26 июля застрелили косолапого 2-3 лет отроду. Однако в радиусе нескольких километров охотники нашли еще следы медведей. Так что убили зверя-людоеда или нет, никто точно сказать не может.","1"
"Bear attack foiled by Justin Bieber’s music: A story too good to check","Just after 12 pm on Tuesday, a story started picking up some serious online momentum.

In the span of about an hour, it appeared on the websites of The Week, Elite Daily, the Daily Mirror, the New York Post, Mediaite, an ABC affiliate, among others.

Here’s how the New York Post’s story began:

Even bears can’t stand Justin Bieber’s music.
A fisherman in Russia was being attacked by a brown bear and escaped death when his Justin Bieber ringtone went off and sent the beast fleeing into the forest.
Animals? Check. A strange and amazing turn of events? Check. Justin Bieber angle when he’s already in the news for a run-in with Orlando Bloom? Check.

Too good to check? Check.

But next thing you know, NPR’s “Morning Edition” covers it, and it ends up in a Seth Meyers monologue:

Here’s the issue: the first story of the bear attack was published in Russian language publication Pravda back on July 31 — and it says nothing about Justin Bieber.

At some point in making the leap to English, someone added a detail to the story that transformed it into a viral hit. According to Google Translate, the original Russian version said the bear was scared away when Igor Vorozhbitsyn’s phone began speaking out the current time. So, yes, the phone apparently scared off the bear mid-mauling. But no Bieber.

Did Vorozhbitsyn change his story in a subsequent interview and realize it was Bieber all along?

Or did someone insert a seemingly false Justin Bieber angle into the story?

Point of Bieberfication

The bear-and-Bieber stories all carried the same pictures of Vorozhbitsyn. They had the same quotes of him explaining that his granddaughter had put the ringtone on his phone.

They quote the same “wildlife expert”: “Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear.”

Hey, thanks for that too-perfect quote to round out the story, anonymous wildlife expert with no credentials!

The symmetry in the stories is because they all used the information contained in a single English language report from a site called the Austrian Times. It’s led by a Brit named Michael Leidig, who also owns the Central European News agency. (His name is listed in the domain owership records for the sites, as well as for CEN’s affiliate agency, EuroPics.)

After the Austrian Times/CEN published the story, it spread to MailOnline.

Once MailOnline had it, the story was off and running. Bieber and the bear was the real deal, and everyone wanted to plant a flag on it. As of this writing, MailOnline’s story has racked up over 13,000 shares.

The images are the first clue as to where the story really came from. MailOnline cited CEN as the copyright holder of the image it used. But the Austrian Times story credits Pravda with the image on its story. A search on the Pravda website turned up the original article with its images and Bieber-less reporting.

So how did the Austrian Times learn of the Bieber angle that Pravda apparently missed?

No answer from Austrian Times/CEN/EuroPics

I called the offices of the Austrian Times and first asked to speak with David Rogers, who is the only person listed on the site. (He is both its ombudsman and its primary sales contact.)

I spoke with a woman who said Rogers was not in the office. When I asked about the story, she said she would follow up with their office in Russia to get the details and would call me back. I asked if their office there typically rewrites things from wires and local press.

“A lot of stories are found on the wire or in local media but also from local interviews on the ground, or we speak to the reporters who wrote them; we speak to police to get things confirmed,” she said.

I called her again later that day to ask if she had news from the Russian office, and she said they are often hard to get ahold of. She never got back to me.

I also called and emailed Leidig, owner of both the Austrian Times, CEN and EuroPics. A man who answered the phone at the CEN office said Leidig is on vacation in Romania.

Leidig, who has lived in Austria for some time, says nothing about himself on the CEN or Times websites, but he has an extensive Wikipedia page. In the section about CEN, it lists MailOnline as one of its clients, though that and much of the page itself offers no citation for the claim. (In 2013, Leidig self-published a book about Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff.)

Along with detailing Leidig’s journalistic achievements, the Wikipedia page includes this passage:

Leidig is also a campaigner for greater support for journalism which he describes as the “coalface of democracy.” He has campaigned in favour of more responsibility from search engines like Google to give credit to original source material and also for payment for originators of news, arguing that if the journalists all go out of business nobody will provide the content worth having.
The sole link in that passage goes to… an article on the Austrian Times. Still, one would hope Pravda is therefore earning some revenue from the story and images that CEN and the Austrian Times plucked from its site. (I contacted Pravda to ask about the images and the story, but have not yet heard back.)

For their part, the Austrian Times, CEN and EuroPics have stopped talking to me. After receiving no information from their Russian bureau, I sent a detailed email Thursday with questions about the Bieber version of the Pravda story and its use — and possible resale — of Pravda images.  No has replied or returned my calls.

Meanwhile, the irresistibly Bieberfied version of the story continues to spread. Entertainment websites and news organizations give it the quick rewrite treatment and link to each other’s versions, completely obscuring the dubious origins of the story.

Too good to check, and now, I suspect, too entrenched to ever be really corrected.","1"
"Sugarhill Gang rapper Big Bank Hank dead at 57","(CNN) -- A member of the Sugarhill Gang, whose pioneering hit ""Rapper's Delight"" brought hip hop to mainstream audiences 35 years ago, died Tuesday of complications from cancer.
""Big Bank Hank,"" whose real name was Henry Jackson, died early Tuesday in Englewood, New Jersey, according to David Mallie, who manages the two surviving Sugarhill Gang members. The New York native was 57.
A beefy, boisterous presence onstage, Hank handled vocals in the early to middle portion of ""Rapper's Delight,"" which despite its extended length -- one version was more than 14 minutes long -- became the first rap song to reach the Top 40 on the U.S. Billboard charts.
Jackson traded rhymes with bandmates ""Wonder Mike"" Wright and Guy ""Master Gee"" O'Brien and spoke some of the song's catchiest lines, including ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn/If your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend.""
Wonder Mike and Master Gee issued a statement Tuesday:
""So sad to hear about our brother's passing. The 3 of us created musical history together with the release of Rapper's Delight. We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house. Rest in peace Big Bank.""
The three friends were unknown MCs when producer Sylvia Robinson recruited them to record the song for her rap label, Sugar Hill Records.

Released in fall 1979, ""Rapper's Delight"" became a novelty hit and a staple at dance clubs well into 1980. It was born from the emerging New York hip-hop scene of the late '70s, in which young rappers gathered in clubs and exchanged rhymes over instrumental breaks from popular songs, most notably Chic's hit ""Good Times.""
""Rapper's Delight"" also borrowed its bass line and other flourishes from ""Good Times,"" prompting threats of legal action by Chic co-founders Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. After a settlement, Rodgers and Edwards were listed as co-writers of the song.
""It felt like a new art form,"" Rodgers said later of ""Rapper's Delight.""
In 2011, Rolling Stone ranked ""Rapper's Delight"" at No. 248 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

As seen on a widely circulating YouTube clip in performance on a local dance show, Big Bank Hank performs with a violet Kangol-style hat and a too-tight T-shirt. The hearty emcee grooves as he rhymes (lip-synced though it may be), lost in music with a fluid pelvic wobble. Next to the more restrained Wonder Mike and Master Gee, he is rap-funk personified. Hank embodies his verse as he raps of out-lasting Superman with a funny line belittling the superhero’s manhood. It's no match for Hank’s “super sperm.”

“I’m here, I’m there, I’m Big Bank Hank, everywhere,” he raps. Again, he had no idea how true that was, though he witnessed the music's evolution over the following decades as the hip-hop style he helped popularize become a form as vital to the ever-evolving story of American music as jazz and country and western.

This line, from the same verse, part of a larger bit involving a sexy reporter, further underscores his import: “She said she’s heard stories and she’s heard fables/That I’m vicious on the mike and the turntables.” That little turn of phrase carved into wax rap’s ongoing love-affair with turntables and microphones.

In the formative “Apache,” the Gang harnessed the titular brass and bongo breakbeat while they shouted, “Tonto, jump on it! Kemosabe, jump on it!” Big Bank Hank then made another claim: “I’m the one who shot Jesse James!”

To call the Sugarhill Gang the “big bang” of hip-hop diminishes the contributions of an entire community that imagined the music at its inception. Big Bank Hank, after all, got his start in the business as a bouncer and managing an act that would become the Cold Crush Brothers. He landed a spot in the Sugarhill Gang when the late music executive Sylvia Robinson tapped him to be part of a pop-oriented rap trio she was putting together.

Jeff Chang’s essential history of hip hop, “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop,” describes the song as standing out amid party-oriented rap of the time due to the group’s birth as a studio creation.


Writes Chang, “Their raps on ‘Rapper’s Delight’ were the stuff that sounded good not in the parties, but on the live bootleg cassettes playing in the OJ cabs and on the boom-boxes --- the funny stories, the hookish slang, the same kind of stuff that would strike listeners around the world as both universal and new, not local and insular.”

“Rapper’s Delight” is considered the best selling 12-inch single of all time, though that’s tough to confirm in the pre-Soundscan era, which began in 1991 (and various litigation involving the track’s unapproved sampling of Chic’s “Good Times” further blurred the issue of numbers).

As happened with most first-generation rap teams (and second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-), Sugarhill Gang failed to sustain a bankable post-hit career, and didn’t receive royalty checks equal to its influence. In the years following the track's success, the style morphed in dozens of different directions, though, becoming politicized through Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, electro-fied through Afrika Bambaataa and popularized through Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys. 

Reverse engineer virtually any rap song since, and the circuitry leads back to ""Rapper's Delight,"" and by extension, Big Bank Hank. His phrasing, his fluid, funky tone, has endured, passed down from rapper to rapper, an invisible but essential presence.

"Big Bank Hank of The Sugarhill Gang is dead at 57","The artist whose real name was Henry Jackson passed away at about 2 a.m. Tuesday in the New York City area. A founding member of 1980s revolutionary hip hop group The Sugarhill Gang, Big Bank Hank was best known for his verses on 'Rapper's Delight,' which was No. 248 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Big Bank Hank, one of the founding members of iconic 1980s hip hop group The Sugarhill Gang, died early Tuesday morning after a battle with cancer. He was 57.

The news was first reported by music blog InFlexWeTrust.com. TMZ reported that the rapper — born Henry Jackson on Aug. 5, 1957, in the Bronx — died at about 2 a.m. Tuesday in the greater New York City area.

“So sad to hear of our brother’s passing,” wrote fellow group members Wonder Mike and Master Gee in a statement to TMZ.

The Sugarhill Gang quickly rose to fame in the 1980s with their hit, 'Rapper's Delight,' and left a legacy as one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time.

Hank’s Sugarhill Gang, which was named after the Sugar Hill neighborood in Manhattan, made music history in 1979 when their single “Rapper’s Delight” became the first hip hop track to be listed in the Top 40 charts in the United States.

The track is widely considered to be the first song to popularize hip hop. Rolling Stone ranked it No. 248 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and it came in at No. 2 on VH1’s 100 Greatest Hip Hop Songs.

Big Bank Hank was born in the Bronx and died in the New York City area.

Henry Jackson loved to rap about trying to steal Lois Lane away from Superman.

Hank, known in his songs as ""the grandmaster with 3 MCs that shock the house for the young ladies,” rapped in his verses about competing with Superman for Lois Lane.

The Sugarhill Gang, a seminal hip group in music history, had five studio albums including their 1980 self-titled record. The group released its last one, ""Jump on It!,"" a hip hop children's album, in 1999.","1"

"No, Vladimir Putin did not get pooped on by a bird during a First World War speech","A YouTube video claimed to show the incident in Moscow but was fake

Monday 04 August 2014

A video of Vladimir Putin apparently being pooped on by a passing bird during a speech has proved to be a fake.

Footage uploaded to YouTube claimed to show the embarrassing incident as the Russian President spoke at the unveiling of a First World War memorial in Moscow on Friday.

Even by Putin’s ice man standards, he did seem remarkably unfazed by the present on his shoulder – probably because it was never there.

In all other footage of the event the bird poo is nowhere to be seen and it does not appear on any pictures taken by multiple international agencies.

If the incident had been real, it would not have been Putin’s first public encounter with an animal’s rear end – in September he drew a cat’s backside for confused Russian pupils on a school visit.

Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister used a picture of his superior with a leopard to show the “different values” between his country and the US and Putin has also been seen “shaking hands” with a walrus and feeding dolphins.

The Russian President is known for using photo opportunities with animals to cultivate his “macho” image.

If his PR is to be believed, he likes nothing more than a holiday horse-riding topless through the wilds of southern Russia, catching huge pike or harpooning whales.

Unluckily for many for the animals involved, Putin’s publicity stunts can end badly, as with the Siberian tiger that died after being over-sedated so the President could attach a GPS transmitter.

"Vladimir Putin Bird Poop Video is Fake","A video that appears to a show a bird pooping on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suit during a speech last week is fake.

The video–uploaded to YouTube–is going viral. A few media outlets appear to have been tricked by it. The video is titled: “Bird pooped on Putin at opening of WWI monument.”

The Washington Post and TIME magazine both posted the video, apparently believing it.

The Post issued a correction, saying that “a bird did not defecate on Russian President Vladimir Putin during a speech on Friday. The video appears to have been a hoax.”

TIME wrote: “A video shared online made it seem as if Vladimir Putin got some unwelcome love from a feathered friend Sunday during a speech unveiling a monument to Russians who served in World War I.”

It later updated the post, saying that “The Independent reveals this video to have been falsely doctored to show a bird defecating on Putin.”

The Associated Press update:

Obama, Putin discuss Ukraine, missile treaty

WASHINGTON (AP) — Capping a week of aggressive action against Russia, President Barack Obama pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday for a diplomatic path out of Ukraine’s struggle with Moscow-backed pro-Russian separatists. Putin countered by calling U.S. and European economic sanctions against Russia counterproductive.

Obama later conceded that pressure from recently imposed U.S. and European measures to squeeze the Russian economy “hasn’t resolved the problem yet.”

In an Obama-initiated phone call Friday, the U.S. president also raised concerns that Russia violated a key Cold War era nuclear weapons treaty, the White House said. In a letter this week from Obama to Putin and in an administration report released this week, the United States said Russia violated a 1987 treaty that bans all U.S. and Russian missiles of intermediate range, meaning those that can travel between about 300 miles and about 3,400 miles.

Putin in the call said the sanctions seriously damage bilateral cooperation and general global stability, according to a Kremlin report on the call.

It was the first conversation between the leaders since the U.S. and Europe slapped the new round of economic sanctions on Russia and since Obama’s letter claiming a breach in the missile treaty.

“I indicated to him, just as we will do what we say we do in terms of sanctions, we’ll also do what we say in terms of wanting to resolve this issue diplomatically if he takes a different position,” Obama told reporters later.

The Kremlin said both Obama and Putin underscored the urgency for bringing an end to fighting in eastern Ukraine and spoke positively about a meeting that took place the day before in Minsk, Belarus, among members of a diplomatic “contact group” pursuing an end to hostilities. That group includes representatives from Russia, Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.","1"
"If Only A Bird Really Did Poop on Putin","The ""too good to be true"" cliche is especially accurate when it comes to viral news stories on perfectly formed dollops of bird crap. On Monday some news sites reported on a hoax video of a pigeon pooping on Putin during his speech on the dangers of military aggression while unveiling a monument in Moscow commemorating the 100th anniversary of World War One. The Independent has a good explainer on why the video below is fake. 

But if it had been real, the symbolism would have been spot on. During his speech, Putin emphasized a strong belief in promoting peace, even as Russia's policies have only provoked and perpetuated violence in Ukraine and Crimea, which he invaded. Despite his words, Russia announced on Monday that it will hold military exercises on its border with Ukraine in a show of strength, according to Reuters. The ""war games"" will include 100 fighter jets and missile practice. 

According to RT, he called the memorial ""'a tribute to the great deeds,' but also a warning that 'this peace is fragile.'"" He said that ""a peaceful and quiet life"" is the most valuable thing on Earth and that ""humankind should grasp one truth: violence generates violence. And the way to peace and prosperity is made up of good will and dialogue, and the memory of the lessons of the last wars."" 

On Friday, the same day Putin gave his poop-free speech, President Obama called Putin again to emphasize his concern over Putin's support of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. Vice President Joe Biden also announced $8 million in new financial aid to Ukraine to help the country protect its borders.","1"
"The video of a bird pooping on Vladimir Putin is a hoax","Correction: This post originally presented the video of a bird pooping on Putin as real, but comparison with Russian news footage from the event shows it to be a hoax. Putin's unintentionally ironic speech decrying ""excessive ambitions in war,"" though, was very real.

The video appeared to show Russian President Vladimir Putin getting pooped on by a bird while giving a speech unveiling a World War One monument in Moscow on Friday. You can see the (fake) freedom bombs land at 0:11 into the above video or you can watch it on repeat, forever, in the gif below.

The Moscow bird poop hoax of 2014 was passed around Western and Russian social media as a small but symbolically satisfying comeuppance for Putin's involvement in Ukraine, where fighting with Russia-backed separatists has killed hundreds of Ukrainians and, two weeks ago, 298 civilians flying overhead in Malaysian Airlines flight 17. Europe and the US have punished Russia with economic sanctions meant to deter further aggression, but this video appeared to show an unknown bird launched some targeted sanctions against the man himself.

Rn0eaqx

This being Russia, getting pooped on by a bird wasn't even the most ridiculous part of Putin's WWI speech. Putin warned that the lesson of WWI was — fair warning, irony is going to die forever at the end of this sentence — to avoid excessive ambitions in war. ""Humankind should grasp one truth: violence generates violence,"" said the man whose overt and ongoing support for separatist rebels in Ukraine, which he also invaded to annex Crimea, has helped claim hundreds of lives and stirred up months of crisis.

""It was on the eve of WWI when Russia did everything possible to solve the conflict peacefully, without bloodshed, between Serbia and Austria-Hungary,"" Putin said, repeating an old Russian complaint that only it really wants peace but is ignored by an aggressive West. ""But Russia wasn't heard. And it had to respond to the challenge in order to protect the [fellow] Slavic nation.""

I'm not sure whether Putin means this as an explicit nod to his involvement in Ukraine, but Russia's meddling there has often been internally premised on the idea that Russia must save the Russian-speakers in Ukraine's east. So there would seem to be a parallel. More ironically, the Ukrainians who are fighting and dying to keep Putin out of their country are themselves Slavic, but must have forgotten to thank Putin for his peace-seeking, pan-Slavic magnanimity.","1"

"No joke: 5-year-old billed for missing friend’s birthday party","TORPOINT — No one likes getting bills, but one bill in particular has a family in Torpoint completely shocked.

According to the Plymouth Herald, it all happened after 5-year-old Alex Nash was invited to a friend’s birthday party at a ski and snowboarding facility.

After Alex was invited to the bash, Nash’s parents told his friend’s mother he would attend the party. But later, they realized they already had made other plans for that day, so Alex missed the party.

Several days later, the little boy came home from school with an envelope in his book bag. It contained an invoice from his friend’s mother for a “child’s party no show fee.”

The total was about $24.

At first, they thought the bill was a joke and the woman they would not be paying the fee. But then, they say, she threatened to take them to small claims court.

They also claimed that Alex’s friend will not play with him anymore.

Alex’s parents are trying to resolve the situation via Facebook.","1"
"“I am lost for words,” 5-year-old boy billed for missing friend’s birthday party","TORPOINT, England – It’s always a shame when a friend can’t make it to a birthday party, but now one family may be paying the price for the no-show.

According to Sky News, 5-year-old Alex Nash was invited to a friend’s birthday party at Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre.

The boy’s father, Derek Nash, said that he accepted the invitation, forgetting about a prior family commitment.

By the time he realized the mistake, Nash said he didn’t have any contact information for the woman.

When Alex returned to school, he was handed an envelope by a teacher.

Nash says the envelope contained a bill for a $24 “child’s party no-show fee.”

“I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words,” Nash told Sky News.

Nash says he is sorry for the mistake but will not be paying for a bill.

"Parents billed $29 for a ‘no-show fee’ after five-year-old son misses birthday party","It’s enough to scare someone off of having children.

Whether it’s gluten or plastics or peanuts, it seems young and new parents have more and more social taboos to navigate.

The latest parenting taboo? Missing a birthday party — or sending an invoice to the absent child’s parents, depending on how you look at it.

A pair of British parents are still reeling from the discovery of an invoice for £15.95 (just under $29 Canadian) in their five-year-old son Alex’s backpack. Their crime? Not informing the parents of his classmate their son would not be attending a birthday party in December.



Julie Lawrence, the birthday boy’s mother, has defended the “fee” as necessary to recoup the costs associated with a no-show. She said Alex told her son he would attend the party and took that as proper confirmation. She said the cost covers one ticket to the “child’s party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch.”

Lawrence has also threatened to take the Nash family to small claims court if they don’t pay up.

Nash has said he understood the financial concerns and said it was the way Lawrence went about it that offended. They have also taken the issue up with the school, because it allowed Lawrence to place the brown envelope in Alex’s backpack, which is against school policy.

So where was Alex? Out with his grandparents, whom he chose over the party when his parents realized he was double booked for the day and it was the only chance he would have to see them before Christmas.

Alex’s mom, Tanya Nash, explained this to Lawrence in a Facebook exchange printed by the Plymouth Herald, the local paper that first broke the story. The ensuing Facebook debate between the two mothers now has parents around the world chiming in.


If Lawrence’s side of the story seems reasonable — she did have to pay for Alex when he didn’t show up after all — the Facebook conversation takes quite the turn. The moms’ fight about whether or not they had each other’s number and who was ruder in how they approached the other parent.

“This is not the first time Alex has not turned up to a party that he has been invited to, either. the amicable way round this I believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt, I hope this is agreeable,” Lawrence writes.

Nash responds that she can’t think of another party Alex missed where there was a formal invite, and the pushes back against Lawrence’s tone: “Exactly what lesson would I be learning? I am not a child, so please do not speak to me like I am one. So, to answer your question, unfortunately no. This is not agreeable.”","1"
"Party invoice: Boy sent bill for birthday no-show","A five-year-old was billed for failing to attend a friend's birthday party - resulting in threats of legal action.

Alex Nash, from Cornwall, was invited to the party just before Christmas.

An invoice for £15.95 was sent by his schoolfriend's mother Julie Lawrence, who said Alex's non-attendance left her out of pocket and his parents had her details to tell her he was not going.

Alex's father Derek said he had been told he would be taken to the small claims court for refusing to pay.

Alex's parents, from Torpoint, had accepted an invitation to the party at a dry ski slope in Plymouth, Devon, just before Christmas.

However, they realised their son was double-booked and due to spend time with his grandparents, which he did.

Analysis: Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent

It is all but impossible that Ms Lawrence will be able to recover the £15.95 party ""no show fee"".

Any claim would be on the basis that a contract had been created, which included a term that a ""no show"" fee would be charged.

However, for there to be a contract, there needs to be an intention to create legal relations. A child's party invitation would not create legal relations with either the child ""guest"" or its parents.

If it is being argued that the contract is with the child, it is inconceivable that a five-year-old would be seen by a court as capable of creating legal relations and entering into a contract with a ""no show"" charge.

It's amusing to imagine what a children's party invitation seeking to create a contract might say: ""I, the 'first party', hereinafter referred to as the 'birthday boy', cordially invite you the 'second party', hereinafter referred to as 'my best friend', to the party of 'the first party'.

His parents said they had no contact information for Ms Lawrence at that time.

They found the invoice in a brown envelope in his schoolbag last week.

Mr Nash said: ""It was a proper invoice with full official details and even her bank details on it.

""I can understand that she's upset about losing money. The money isn't the issue, it's the way she went about trying to get the money from me.

""She didn't treat me like a human being, she treated me like a child and that I should do what she says.""

In a short statement, Ms Lawrence said: ""All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me.""

Mr Nash said he had been told he was being taken to the small claims court because he was refusing to pay.

The party was held at the Plymouth Ski and Snowboard Centre.

In a statement, the centre said: ""We would like all our customers to know that this invoice has nothing to do with Plymouth Ski and Snowboard Centre.

""No invoices are ever sent out from the centre to private individuals. This is a disagreement between the two parents involved and the fact that the centre has been named on the invoice is fraudulent.

""When booking a party there is a small deposit to pay on booking, confirmation of numbers and final balance are due 48 hours before the party.

""On the extremely rare occasion that people don't attend parents are generally offered other activities in compensation.""

"Boy, 5, billed with 'no show fee' for missing friend's BIRTHDAY PARTY","A FIVE-YEAR-OLD boy has been billed with a ""no show fee"" - for missing his friend's BIRTHDAY party.

Derek Nash and his partner discovered the invoice - for the sum of £15.95 - after it was slipped into their son Alex's school bag.

The host of the party gave it to Alex via a teacher after he failed to show up for the get-together at a ski slope and snowboard centre in Plymouth, Cornwall.

Alex's family confirmed that their son would be attending the party just before the Christmas holidays.

But Mr Nash, from Torpoint, Cornwall, realised he had arranged for their daughter to go on a day trip with her grandparents.

He then asked Alex if he wished to join his sister or go to the party, to which he chose to spend time with his grandparents.

Bemused Mr Nash said he originally thought the invoice ""was a joke"", but the issue has remained unresolved and now the birthday boy's mother has threatened to take him to a small claims court.

He said: ""She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.""

However, after Alex had changed his mind about the party, Ms Nash realised he had no way of contacting the birthday boy's mother.

""So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do - he chose to be with his grandparents,"" he said.

""By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy's mother] know.""

Alex returned to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School on January 6, but just over a week later, the family were stunned to receive the bill.

Mr Nash continued: ""My partner looked out for [the friend's mother] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn't see her.

""But on January 15 she looked in Alex's school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for 15.95 for a child's party no show fee.

""I asked Alex's class teacher if [the child's mother] had given anything to her. She said, 'Yes, a brown envelope'.

""I then visited Alex's school headteacher, who couldn't apologise enough that one of the teachers had passed this on.

""She said she would remind all staff that this was a breach of protocol.""

He then went to visit the mother, since named as Julie Lawrence and whose address was on the invoice, and told her that he would not be paying the bill.

""I told her she should have spoken to me first and not put the invoice in my son's school bag,"" he said.

""I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up, but I just can't believe the way she has gone around it.""

The mother has since threatened the family to take the case to a small claims court, while the birthday boy will no longer play with Alex at school.

Mr Nash added: ""I drive all around the South West for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this.

""They're all quite incredulous that this has happened. I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words.""

His partner, who does not want to be named, has been in contact with the mum on Facebook and is hoping to resolve the situation.

In a short statement, Ms Lawrence said she had no regrets about sending the invoice.

She said: ""All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me.""

Manager of the Plymouth ski and snowboard centre, Louisa Duggan, said they would never send invoices to individuals and were upset at being dragged into the row.

She said: ""This is nothing to do with us. It is a dispute between two parents. But I really need to clarify that we don't send invoices to private individuals - ever.

""We don't know the names of the children coming so we would never even be able to.

""We are upset that we have been dragged into this. We ask families who book with us to pay a small deposit and then 48 hours before we ask them to confirm the numbers.

""This gives them plenty of time to get responses in. We are quite flexible if any of the party does not turn up.

""We can put on other activities to compensate or often an adult will take part in place.

""We do need to know how many people are coming because we have to plan food and reserve activities and spaces. That is how any businesses like ours has to operate.""","1"
"Torpoint: Five-Year-Old Billed For Missing Friend’s Birthday Party In England","A five-year-old boy in Torpoint, England, ended up missing a friend’s birthday party, and he did it without any advance notice. Due to his no-show at his friend’s party, the young child was actually given an invoice and billed for his nonappearance.

According to the Plymouth Herald, Derek Nash says that his son Alex was given a “child’s party no show fee” invoice for not going to a friend’s birthday party. The bill for £15.95 (approx. $25) was in his son’s school bag last week and Nash “thought it was a joke.”

The party was scheduled for before the Christmas holidays when Alex was invited to one of his Torpoint Nursery and Infant School classmate’s birthday party. It was being held at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre, and the Nash family indicated that Alex would be attending the party.

“She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.”

As the Metro stated, Nash informed the classmate’s mother in person that his son would be going to the party. It was after that conversation that Nash realized the family already had a family trip planned for that day.

Upon trying to cancel Alex’s acceptance to the party, Nash found no way to contact the party-thrower.

“We did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy’s mother] know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do – he chose to be with his grandparents.”

It was a week later that the invoice for Alex’s no-show was received. A teacher at the Torpoint Nursery and Infant School is actually the one who put the notice in the boy’s school bag, and the school has since issued an apology for their involvement in the matter.

Alex’s teacher said that she would let all staff know that giving the boy an invoice was a “breach of protocol.”

Derek Nash said he then left the school and went to visit the birthday boy’s mother since her address was now on the invoice. He let her know that he “would not be paying her the money” and that “she should have spoken to me first.”

The birthday boy’s mother has since threatened the Nash family with legal action and could possibly take them to small claims court to get the money she is owed.

As for Alex Nash and his classmate at the Torpoint Nursery? He has told his parents that his classmate won’t play with him at school now since he was a no-show to the party and the invoice was given out.

Alex's parents fear they may be dragged into a court battle - all because their son chose a day out with his grandparents over a pal's birthday party

Just before the Christmas holidays, Alex, their son, was invited to a classmate’s Birthday party at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre.

Alex, who goes to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School, told his parents he wanted to go and so Mr Nash and his partner confirmed he would be at the celebration.

Mr Nash said: “She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.”

But Mr Nash later realised he had arranged for Alex and his sister Lily to out for a day trip with their grandparents.

“By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy’s mother] know,” explained Mr Nash.

“So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do; he chose to be with his grandparents.”

On January 6 Alex went back to school as the new term got under way.

Mr Nash continued: “My partner looked out for [the friend’s mother] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn’t see her.

“But on January 15 she looked in Alex’s school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for £15.95 for a child’s party no show fee.

The bill Alex brought home. He was not charged VAT on his birthday party no-show...

“I asked Alex’s class teacher if [the child’s mother] had given anything to her. She said, ‘Yes, a brown envelope’.

“I then visited Alex’s school headteacher, who couldn’t apologise enough that one of the teachers had passed this on.

“She said she would remind all staff that this was a breach of protocol.”

“I left the school and went to see [the birthday boy’s mother] as her address was on the invoice.

“When she answered the door I told her I had found the invoice in my son’s school bag and that I wasn’t happy about it.

“I told her I would not be paying her the money.

“I told her she should have spoken to me first and not put the invoice in my son’s school bag.”

He added: “I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up, but I just can’t believe the way she has gone around it.”

The couple claim that the mother of Alex’s friend has threatened the couple with taking the case to the small claims court.

And five-year-old Alex has told his parents that his classmate will no longer play with him after he didn’t show up to the party.


Poor Alex says his friend will no longer play with him at school since the row broke out

Mr Nash said: “I drive all around the South West for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this.

“They’re all quite incredulous that this has happened.

“I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words.”

Mr Nash’s partner has been in contact with the mum via Facebook hoping to resolve the situation.

The mother of Alex’s friend was unavailable for comment when contacted by The Herald.


Full Facebook conversation between Alex's mum Tanya and the birthday boy's mum Julie.

Tanya Walsh

Hi Julie. This is Alex's mum. I don't know what has happened between you and my partner, Derek. I was very shocked to see the invoice in Alex's school bag. I did not realise that you had to pay for each child, as you never mentioned anything about money when we spoke. The only reason Alex did not attend the party was because his nan and grandad were going away for christmas and the only day the kids could go see them was on the same day as the party. I did not know this. On the day Alex decided that he wanted to spend time with his nan and grandad. I apologise for not letting you know, but I did not have a phone number or an e-mail for you to let you know the situation(I also didn't know your first name, or I would have looked you up). If I had known that I would have to pay if Alex did not go, then I would have paid you the money, no problem. I do not like fighting with people, and would prefer to settle this amicably.

Julie Lawrence

Hi Tanya, I didn't mention the money when we spoke because it was a child's party, it doesn't matter if you have to pay per person or for a group if people agree to going, I confirmed that with all parents on the Thursday before the party that they were going as I had to pay that day, and Derek told me Alex was looking forward to it and would see us there, to me that is confirmation. My phone number was on the invitation that was sent out to Alex. I don't like fighting with people either, and was not best impressed when Derek turned up on my doorstep, and said you won't get any money out of me, rather rudely, I do admit it rattled me. This is not the first time Alex has not turned up to a party that he has been invited to, either. the amicable way round this I believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt, I hope this is agreeable ? Julie

Tanya Walsh

Hi Julie, who's party is Alex supposed to have gone to? I did speak to another mum about a party but she never got back to me with details, other than that I don't recall any other confirmed invites. The only reason Derek was angry was because of the fact that the envelope was put into Alex's school bag, when it has nothing to do with the school. He spoke to the headteacher about and she said that it's against school policy to do that kind of thing. Birthday invites are fine, but not personal items. Like I said before, no money was mentioned when we spoke, and I feel it would be inappropriate to pay you the money, when I don't know what it's actually paying for. Alex was very excited to go to the party. I didn't know until the day about his nan and grandad, and he decided he would rather spend the day with them. Like I said before I didn't have your number to let you know. And exactly what lesson would I be learning. I am not a child, so please do not speak to me like I am one. So, to answer your question, unfortunately no. This is not agreeable.

Julie Lawrence

You are paying for 1 x child's party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch, to with you said Alex was attending on the Thursday

Tanya Walsh

Just so you know, small claims court cost #60 just to start a claim. Also I'm not paying for something we didn't use.

Julie Lawrence

It doesn't cost that much

Tanya Walsh

It does. Also I don't think the school are very happy with you involving them in this either. I don't know why you are out for our blood and slandering us. I've told you the reasons why alex didn't go. I also told you why I couldn't call. You also don't seem to understand that I never ran away from you. I didnt hear you calling after me. I have to get to my daughter at carbeile. So if they let alex out last then I have to rush a bit because evie, my 2 year old, walks slow. So maybe that's why you thought I was rushing off. I had no reason to run to run away from you. So please do not state things as truth when you do not have all the facts. Maybe if you actually spoke to me rather than making your own mind up about what happened then none of this would be happening right now. If you had come up to us the first day back and explained about the money, then I could have explained about alex, then maybe we could have sorted something out. Instead you send an invoice.","1"
"Boy, 5, given £15.95 invoice for missing friend's birthday party","A five-year-old has been handed an invoice and his parents threatened with court action - for missing his friend's birthday party.

Derek Nash and his partner Tanya Walsh discovered the £15.95 ""no show fee"" invoice after it was slipped into their son Alex's school bag.

Mr Nash said he originally ""thought it was a joke"", but the issue has remained unresolved with the birthday boy's mother, Julie Lawrence, threatening small claims court.

His partner confronted Ms Lawrence in a series of posts on Facebook in a bid to resolve the situation.

The family confirmed their son would be attending the party at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre just before the Christmas holidays.

However, Mr Nash, from Torpoint, Cornwall, realised he had already arranged for their daughter to go on a day trip with her grandparents.

He said: ""She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.

""By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy's mother] know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do - he chose to be with his grandparents.""

Alex returned to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School on January 6, but the family were shocked to receive the bill just over a week later.

Mr Nash added: ""My partner looked out for [the friend's mother] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn't see her.

""But on January 15 she looked in Alex's school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for £15.95 for a child's party no show fee.

Julie Lawrence and her husband Simon

""I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up, but I just can't believe the way she has gone around it.""

Ms Lawrence has since threatened the family that she would take the case to a small claims court, while the birthday boy will no longer play with Alex at school.

Mr Nash added: ""I drive all around the south west for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this. They're all quite incredulous that this has happened. I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words.""

Ms Lawrence said the boy's non-attendance left her out of pocket and insisted his parents did have details to tell her he was not going.

She said in a statement: ""All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me.""","1"
"Fake-News Report Claims Michael Jackson Is Father Of Bruno Mars","According to this 'news' report, which is circulating via social media, DNA testing has confirmed that Michael Jackson is the biological father of American singer Bruno Mars.

Supposedly, Bruno's publicist Vladimir Kershov leaked the private information and was subsequently fired for his actions.  But, claims the article, Bruno's new publicist has nevertheless confirmed that Michael Jackson is indeed Bruno's father.

However, the claims in the story are untrue. No such private information was leaked and there are no credible reports that support the claims.

The bogus story comes from the fake-news website Empire News. Empire News considers itself satirical.  The site includes the following disclaimer:

Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.
But, alas, because the site presents its fictional stories in news format, many readers tend to believe them and share them accordingly.  

Given the number of fake-news 'satire' websites that have sprung up in recent years, it is a good idea to verify any 'news' stories that come your way before you share them. Searching a news portal such as Google News will usually reveal if a circulating story is true.

DNA Results Confirm Michael Jackson Is Biological Father Of Bruno Mars
NEW YORK, New York - DNA Results Confirm Michael Jackson Is Biological Father Of Bruno Mars
Vladimir Kershov, publicist of R&B singer Bruno Mars, has been fired today after he revealed a shocking secret regarding the pop and R&B singer. Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars’ biological father.

"No, Michael Jackson Isn’t Bruno Mars’ Dad","Michael Jackson, legendary as he was as the King of Pop, wasn’t the most the popular dad in showbiz. Ever since the Berlin baby-dangling incident of ’02, the media has tirelessly and unfairly portrayed him as an irresponsible and detached father (before his death, Jackson had shown remorse for the incident). This depiction was unfortunately fueled by his own erratic behavior during the final years of his life, and the sexual abuse charges that chased Jackson a few years before his death certainly didn’t help with his image.

This week, social media went crazy over a “news” article that had been circulating Facebook and Twitter like wildfire. An article published by Empire News entitled, “DNA Results Confirm Michael Jackson Is Biological Father Of Bruno Mars,” has unsurprisingly shocked and enraged fans of both singers across the internet.

The story went on to detail how the Billionaire singer allegedly and inadvertently revealed where he got his singing genes. The article wrote that the discovery involved Mars’ firing of a certain Vladimir Kershov, the singer’s reported publicist.

“Vladimir Kershov, publicist of R&B singer Bruno Mars, has been fired today after he revealed a shocking secret regarding the pop and R&B singer. Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars’ biological father.”

Gullible netizens went insane over the Michael Jackson-Bruno Mars story, not realizing that Empire News, an Onion-like website (without the funny), publishes mostly “satirical” and made-up articles. Fact-checking website Snopes has since labelled the story “false”.

According to Bruno’s Wikipedia page, the half-Filipino singer was born to Peter Hernandez and Bernadette Bayot in 1985 and was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. Meanwhile, Michael was, at the time, not involved with anyone, although he was already beginning to form a relationship with future-wife Lisa Marie Presley.

While Jackson was often portrayed as a bad dad in tabloids, he was, in reality, an amazing father to his kids Michael Jr, Paris and Prince. Shortly after his death, MTV revealed never-before seen correspondence with people closest to Michael, most of whom attested to the fact that the singer was a caring and loving dad to his children. Producer and Jackson’s friend Teddy Reily recalled, “Michael] read them a book every day. When we were in Virginia during the Invincible [sessions], there was not one day missed reading the children something. So that showed me right there that he was an incredible father.”

In other news, Michael Jackson’s brothers continue to celebrate his musical legacy through various performances around the world. Inquisitr recently reported about the brothers’ upcoming UAE concert, which is set to be attended by thousands of fans.

"Penis Spray-Painted on a $2.5 Million Car Was Just for a Prank Video","In this week's edition of lies, fakes, pranks and cheats on the Internet, we bring you a spray-painted penis on a very expensive car. Seriously.

It all began with a picture of a poorly drawn penis on the hood of a $2.5 million Bugatti Veyron that appeared on Reddit.

Image: Imgur

But as the automotive blog Car Crushing pointed out, the artwork was most likely done for a planned prank video.

Instagram user andreysmygov posted a photo of the elementary-level NSFW drawing with the caption, ""How often do [yo]u get to spray paint on a Bugatti lol,"" crediting the TwinzTV YouTube channel and crew, who also posted photos of the vehicle mentioning a prank.

The proof:

"Bugatti Veyron Vandalized With Penis Graffiti? Viral Photo Isn’t What It Seems","Did you see the Bugatti Veyron that was vandalized with penis graffiti in Seattle? Well, it may have not actually been a crime.

Several people were angry this week when they saw a photo of the $2.5 million car with a big penis drawn across the hood. How could someone vandalize such a beautiful piece of machinery! Well, it doesn’t appear like this was the work of vandals.

A photo of the car was uploaded to Instagram by AndreysMyGov of VG Productions. Andrey writes that the car was purposefully spray painted for an upcoming music video.


Andrey writes: “Yea bro it’s for an upcoming video we working on. It’s gonna be sick stay tuned bro two Bugatti videos coming in the next couple weeks.” Andrey claims that it’s real spray paint but that may not be true. Here’s another photo with a different red mark, “VG,” on the car.


The most recent photo from Andrey’s account shows the Bugatti Veyron without any markings. Either VG Productions has a garage full of disposable cars of they are using some sort of paint that is very easy to remove.


Regardless, VG Productions did what they wanted to do and created a buzz on the internet. The story has been picked up by dozens of publications and the photos have been shared thousands of time on social media.

"Cesar Millan is Not Dead: Dog Whisperer Death Hoax Circulates","A story circulating online claims that Dog Whisperer Cesar Millan died of a heart attack. That report, however, is false.

Death Hoax

In a report published by Unam Noticias, we read that Millan died in a Santa Clarita hospital of a heart attack. The story states that Millan’s death was announced by his wife at a press conference. The article, as of this writing, has received nearly 20,000 shares online.

The report, however, is not true.

cesar millan

Some shocked readers shared the sad news on social media, without first verifying the claims in the report. Although as of this writing, neither Millan nor his representatives have responded to the death hoax, there are several factors which indicate the article is not true.

Consider:

The original report does not cite any sources.
No legitimate media outlets have reported Millan’s death
There is no evidence that Millan’s wife held a press conference
There has been no such announcement on Millan’s official Facebook page.
The story on Unam Noticias is rife with grammatical and spelling errors (example: “Millan was hospitalize yesterday afternoon, the medical reports indicate that he suffered a fulminate heart attack, which paralyze his heart unavailable for the blood…”
Bottom Line

The report claiming that Cesar Millan died of a heart attack appears to be yet another celebrity death hoax. The poorly-written source of this report offered no sources and has received no corroboration from trusted media outlets or representatives of Millan.","1"

"The news of Cesar Millan's death is false","Celebrity Dog Cesar Millan should have died, according to a post on the site noticiasunam.com. But there are many obvious oddities in the post - Viral Inspector shows why it probably is fake.

TV Personality and hunduppfostraren Cesar Millan has died of a heart attack, reports the site noticiasunam.com . The news has been widely adopted - just over 17,000 interactions on Facebook accordance sharedcount.com - and shocked many. ""Oh, becomes so sad. Rest in paradise Cesar Millan! ""Writes one of many Swedes who have turned to Facebook to express their condolences.

But they probably unnecessarily. It is unclear what exactly noticiasumam.com is a kind side, but a reputable news source, it is at least not.

To begin with, there are many warning signs about the article itself if Millan's death. It is the Hispanic-side single article in English, and has under its byline written by Frank William Abagnale, a famous forger of checks whose lives laid the basis for the movie ""Catch Me If You Can"". And whatever Abagnale do nowadays so it's probably not writing for noticiasumam.com.

Additionally, it stated the source of the claim to be a press conference with Millan's wife, Jahira Dar. Searches shows that this press conference is not mentioned anywhere else than right on noticiasumam.com, which almost certainly means that the conference never even took place. To make doubly sure is Jahira Dar and Cesar Millan not actually married, at least according to a mingling article in the Daily Mail from November 23. 

According to the article, Millan have been put in the hospital ""yesterday afternoon"", ie on Tuesday. But the night of Wednesday, Swedish time appeared still up happy tweets and status updates on Millans Twitter - and Facebook feeds  - the last came as late as an hour before the site's article was published. Cesar Millan has a television program on the National Geographic, nor where there any information about his death.

If there are rumors about a celebrity death so you should always wait until they are confirmed by a close relative or associate of the person, in an interview with a credible source. In the case of Millan, there is no such confirmed data, and both Indian International Business Times  as Dutch De Telegraaf  warns that page that published the news is not credible.

Viral reviewer can therefore conclude that the source of the allegation of Cesar Millan's death is not credible. Although Millan's team have not directly denied the information we dare say he most certainly not dead. We have searched his team for comment.","1"

"China: Satirical site warns citizens over name choices","A satirical website has poked fun at the Chinese practice of choosing alternative English names, in a report urging citizens to think carefully before making their decision.

The site, which is done in the style of the state-owned CCTV website, warns people against picking a name that could cause offence, or simply make no sense at all. Many Chinese people prefer to use an English name, particularly if they conduct business with the West. But the satirical site suggests people should avoid fictional characters, names with the potential for sexual innuendo, or random words like Dragon, Fish or Lawyer, which could come back and haunt you ""if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America"".

An English name should ""come with a 'feeling' or idea about what sort of person you are, and where you come from"", so names such as Satan or Dumbledore are out, the website says. Women are told to think carefully about ""food"" names such as Candy, Lolly or Sugar, which might be seen as ""stripper names"". There's also a lengthy warning about names with sexual connotations, especially when used in conjunction with Dong or Wang, which ""are used as slang for male genitalia... so avoid anything like 'Bunny Wang' at all times,"" the website says. Instead, a ""traditional"" name like Elizabeth, Catherine, William or George is considered a good choice. ""Pick one of these if you're looking for a 'safe' English name, often with implications of wealth,"" the website advises.

"Satirical news site attacks China’s weird English names","A humorous report on a satirical Web site done in the style of China's state broadcaster CCTV offers advice to Chinese on how to choose their English names. ""English names come with different connotations. It’s not always fair to those people, but they do,"" the article warns. ""A name can come with a ‘feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are, and where you come from.""

The adoption of unconventional English names in China and other parts of East Asia is the source of perennial fascination and mirth among expats. Any young Anglophone who teaches English in the region could rattle off a host of perplexing names he or she had to call out during class.

One friend of WorldViews who taught English and civics in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou had a number of students whose chosen English names were derived from screen names used during online computer games. There was Orcapm, who was not to be outdone by Skycoolz.

""Sure, have fun and pick a random object or word as a name, but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America,"" the post chides. It offers this guide:

A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms. They’re full of name stereotypes — you’ll find the good girls’ are all ‘Jane’s, the jock boys’ are still ‘Buds’ and the geeks’ are called ‘Sheldon’.

The report also lays out a set of rules governing the types of English names typically adopted by Chinese. Be careful about what may sound inappropriate alongside common Chinese family names such as Wang or Dong. In general, it's good to avoid food as a name, it suggests.

To put bluntly, names like Candy, Lolly, Sugar (think anything sweet), are typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.

It’s not always right; there are doubtless some very smart Candy’s out there. But it’s the first thing that comes to mind.

Other instructions include eschewing the names of famous leaders or celebrities. ""Pick any name like Obama, Einstein or Madonna and you’re going to get some stares,"" it says. ""You have some pretty big shoes to fill there.""

At a McDonald's restaurant in Hong Kong, WorldViews once was served by an employee whose badge confusingly read ""Franco Mussolini."" One hopes he didn't harbor similar dreams of power and domination.

While it's easy to make fun of such unusual naming conventions, it's also hard not to appreciate the playfulness with which these names get chosen. Often, Chinese people pick an English name as a play of words based on their original given Chinese name. The Atlantic offers a few examples from the Cantonese-speaking city of Hong Kong:

Many English names mimic the sound of Chinese given names. A solicitor called Tse Kar-son, for example, has Carson as his English name. Singer Lee Hak-kan's English name is Hacken. Another singer, Chan Yik-shun, is called Eason...

Ho Wai-leuk, a journalist, got his name another way. ""When I was a student, everyone kept saying my Chinese name really fast until it started sounding like 'hoh lok,'"" he said referring to the Cantonese pronunciation for Coca-Cola, ""so Cola stuck.""

For most people, our names are our names and we have little choice in the matter. But the practice of adopting a new English name can be seen as an exercise in self-expression, especially in societies where larger trends of conformity hold some sway.

Who wouldn't want to be able to re-brand themselves or be able to highlight some unique part of their identity? Just don't use that power to call yourself ""Bunny Wang,"" the post says.

"Comcast calls rumor that it disconnects Tor users “wildly inaccurate”","Comcast has lately found itself issuing public apologies on a somewhat regular basis as subscribers share tales of horrible customer service.

But the latest accusation leveled against Comcast—that it is threatening to disconnect customers who use the anonymity-providing Tor browser—hasn't been backed by convincing evidence that it's happening. And Comcast dismisses the rumor as “wildly inaccurate.”

It began Saturday with a site called DeepDotWeb claiming that Comcast has “declared war on Tor Browser.”

“Reports have surfaced (Via /r/darknetmarkets and another one submitted to us) that Comcast agents have contacted customers using Tor and instructed them to stop using the browser or risk termination of service,” the article said. “A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an ‘illegal service.’ The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies. The Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer. The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor.”

“Kelly” allegedly told the customer that “Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the Internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules.”

“I think the story is nonsense”

There was good reason to be skeptical of this report. A search of the subreddit /r/darknetmarkets for Comcast and Tor turned up nothing. (UPDATE: Here is the reddit post quoted by DeepDotWeb.) Any organized Comcast campaign against users of Tor would likely inspire numerous customer complaints, not just a few, as noted by Cato Institute Research Fellow Julian Sanchez and security researcher Robert Graham, who wrote on Twitter:


""This story is wildly inaccurate,"" Comcast spokesperson Charlie Douglas told Ars. ""Customers are free to use their Xfinity Internet service to visit any website or use it however they wish otherwise.""

While Comcast publishes an acceptable use policy, the company ""doesn’t monitor users’ browser software or Web surfing and has no program addressing the Tor browser,"" Douglas said.

In some previous cases where customers have documented poor customer service, Comcast has admitted fault and said its customer service agents acted in error. In this case, Comcast says it investigated the story and found no evidence that the encounters ever happened.

""The anecdotal chat room evidence provided is not consistent with our agents’ messages and is not accurate,"" Douglas said. ""Per our own internal review, we have found no evidence that these conversations took place, nor do we employ a Security Assurance team member named Kelly. We respect customer privacy and security and only investigate and disclose certain information about a customer's account with a valid court order or other appropriate legal process.""

Comcast's Jason Livingood, VP of Internet communications and engineering, also disputed the report in a blog post today. ""Our customers can use Tor at any time, as I have myself. I’m sure many of them are using it right now,"" he wrote.

The DeepDotWeb report has other problems. It falsely stated that ""Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the 'Six Strikes' plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are e-mailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity. Comcast will continue monitoring them, and if they violate the 'Six Strikes' plan five more times, their Internet service will be terminated.""

In fact, Six Strikes reports are the result of content companies monitoring online activity and notifying Internet service providers of potential violations. Comcast says it uses e-mail and in-browser alerts to ""educate"" customers about copyright violations, but it doesn't cut off service. Nonetheless, the DeepDotWeb report was credulously re-reported by a few other news outlets that didn't seek further confirmation. The stories are being shared by Twitter users, who often add expressions of outrage:


Tor isn't for criminals

Tor Project Executive Director Andrew Lewman told Ars that it doesn't have enough information on the Comcast rumors ""to know whether this is a company-wide practice."" He noted that ""people with uncensored connections to the Internet can use Tor to share their access with human rights defenders and journalists behind national firewalls. We tend to have good relationships with Internet service providers in free societies for this reason.""

Tor itself was unfairly branded ""the Web browser for criminals"" by one news report:


Enlarge
Business Insider
While Tor can be used by criminals, it was created by the US Naval Research Laboratory to protect government communications and is used by many people with privacy concerns, including activists in countries with repressive governments. For anyone hoping to use Tor to mask downloads of pirated material, the Tor Project itself says that ""File sharing (peer-to-peer/P2P) is widely unwanted in the Tor network, and exit nodes are configured to block file sharing traffic by default."" (Comcast was caught interfering with BitTorrent traffic in 2007.)

If the customers described by DeepDotWeb did have discussions with Comcast employees, it's possible they were being notified of a pending legal action. DeepDotWeb quoted Comcast as saying, ""if we’re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.""

Douglas told Ars that ""it's impossible to speculate"" whether that's what happened in this case, since the reports mentioned no specific customers.

If any Ars readers are subscribers of Comcast and use the Tor browser, we'd love to hear about your experiences in the comments.","1"
"Setting the record straight on tor","On Monday morning, a report surfaced claiming that Comcast has been discouraging customers from using the Tor Browser, a browsing program designed to allow users to surf the Internet with greater anonymity than most browsers. Monday’s report was repackaged on a number of other sites, stating that Comcast has ""declared war on the Tor Browser."" The report goes on to suggest that Comcast has contacted some users telling them that they risk disconnection if they continue using Tor. The report may have generated a lot of clicks but is totally inaccurate.  

Comcast is not asking customers to stop using Tor, or any other browser for that matter. We have no policy against Tor, or any other browser or software. Customers are free to use their Xfinity Internet service to visit any website, use any app, and so forth. 

Here are the facts:

Comcast doesn’t monitor our customer’s browser software, web surfing or online history.

The anecdotal chat room evidence described in these reports is not accurate.  

We respect customer privacy and security and only investigate and disclose certain information about a customer's account with a valid court order or other appropriate legal process, just like other ISPs. More information about these policies can be found in our Transparency Report here.

"Comcast Denies It Will Cut Off Customers Who Use Tor, The Web Browser For Criminals","Some users of the anonymous web browser Tor have reported that Comcast has threatened to cut off their internet service unless they stop using the legal software.

Comcast completely denies their claims. In a blog post, the company said ""We have no policy against Tor, or any other browser or software. Customers are free to use their Xfinity Internet service to visit any website, use any app, and so forth.""

According to a report on Deepdotweb, Comcast customer representatives have branded Tor ""illegal"" and told customers that using it is against the company's policies.

Tor is a type of web browser that, in theory, makes all your internet activity private. The software routes traffic through a series of other connected internet users, making it difficult for governments and private companies to monitor your internet usage. Up to 1.2 million people use the browser, which became especially popular after Edward Snowden leaked information showing that the NSA was eavesdropping on ordinary citizens. Prior to that, Tor had been popular among people transacting business on Silk Road, the online market for drugs and hitmen.

The problem is that downloading or using Tor itself isn't illegal. Plenty of people might have legitimate reasons to want to surf the web in private, without letting others know what they were looking at. But Tor has been pretty popular with criminals.

Some Comcast reps allegedly begun telling users that it is an ""illegal service."" One Comcast representative, identified only as Kelly, warned a customer over his use of Tor software, DeepDotWeb reports:

Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.

Comcast customers, speaking to Deepdotweb, claimed that Comcast repeatedly asked them which sites they were accessing using Tor.

In a statement to Business Insider, Comcast refuted the claims made in Deepdotweb, stating that they had launched an internal review into the discussions reported above:

Customers are free to use their Xfinity Internet service to visit any website or use it however they wish otherwise. Like virtually all ISPs, Comcast has an acceptable use policy or AUP that outlines appropriate and inappropriate uses of the service. Comcast doesn’t monitor users’ browser software or web surfing and has no program addressing the Tor browser. he anecdotal chat room evidence provided is not consistent with our agents’ messages and is not accurate. Per our own internal review, we have found no evidence that these conversations took place, nor do we employ a Security Assurance team member named Kelly. Tor’s own FAQs clearly state: 'File sharing (peer-to-peer/P2P) is widely unwanted on Tor' and 'BitTorrent is NOT anonymous' on Tor.

"Comcast Says You Can Keep Your Tor","Reports that Comcast will deny Internet service to users of the Tor Internet browser are false, the company says in a new blog post.

"The Whole Internet Is Waiting For This Pic Of A Monster 50-Foot Crab To Be Declared A Hoax","A giant crab photographed in a harbour mouth in Kent, UK, is proving a great drawcard… for the website that’s claiming it’s a giant crab.

Weird Whitstable curator Quinton Winter believes he lives in the UK’s weirdest town and hosts a collection of pics and reports on his website to prove it.

But even he couldn’t believe this aerial photograph of a 50-foot crab lurking in the shallows off the harbour:


Crab, sandbank, or Photoshopping idiot? Picture: Weird Whitstable
So he went to check it out for himself.

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’,” Winter said.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

Oh, internet. As great as it would be for this to be genuine, we’re counting down to the hoax bust in 3… 2… 1… but secretly hoping it’s real.","1"
"Is 'Crabzilla' real or not? Leading marine biologist rules picture of giant crab lurking in shallow waters must be a HOAX","A marine biologist has killed off claims that a giant crab is living on the Kent coast - insisting the image is probably a well-doctored hoax.

Residents of Whitstable were left shocked when a photo emerged appearing to show a huge crustacean just yards from the coastal town's harbour.

But sea-life expert Dr Verity Nye, who has worked on logging new species of crab, says it is impossible one of the creatures could grow so big.

This image of Whistable harbour from above led to claims that a 'Crabzilla' could be living off the Kent coast

The image (left) appears to show a crustacean the length of five or six boats lurking in the Thames Estuary, but marine biologist Dr Verity Nye (right) says the picture is a hoax

Dr Nye, an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton, said: 'The idea of a giant ""crabzilla"" would very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax.

'I don't know what the currents are like around that harbour or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.'

She added: 'The UK does have large crabs. The biggest is the spider crab which can grow up to 1.2 metres in size, but they tend to stay in much deeper water, about 1,000-metres deep, and are a different shape from the image in this photo.

'Crabs with a ""pie crust edge"", like the one in the crabzilla image, are known as edible crabs, or Cancer pagarus, but tend only to grow to about 20 to 30 centimetres.'

Mocked-up photos poking fun at the idea of a Crabzilla were posted on Twitter after the image emerged

The largest crabs in British waters are spider crabs, which live in waters between 10 and 1,000 metres deep

Edible crabs, shaped like the one in the aerial photo of Whitstable, grow to only 30 centimetres long

Dr Nye added: 'The largest crabs in the world are Japanese Spider Crabs, which can grow to about 3.7 metres in size, about as big as a small car, but again, they tend to stay in deep water and don't come ashore.

'Crabs are amazing because they are so diverse, we have about 60 species around the UK, and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found, but I laughed when I saw this picture.'

The photograph of the apparent 50ft crustacean was originally posted on a blog called Weird Whistable, a collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

The image has sparked a rash of less believable online images, with Twitter users mocking up their own pictures of giant claws emerging from the water.","1"
"Five reasons 'Crabzilla' is definitely not real","Leading invertebrate researcher says ""a hoax is an understatement"" of photograph appearing to show a colossal crustacean basking off the Kent coastline

A fifty-foot crab dwelling somewhere off the English coast is a thing of nightmares.

The shadowy figure of a colossal crustacean, apparently spotted in the murky waters of Whistable, in Kent, dwarfs boats and cars on the pier it lurks besides.

A satellite picture of the so-called crab, aptly dubbed ‘Crabzilla’, has gone viral after first surfacing on Weird Whitstable, a website for the supernatural curated by illustrator Quinton Winter, which deals in “phantoms, mysteries, tall tales, and artefacts”.

The creature is depicted in the coastal town’s harbour, which is a popular spot for children to go crabbing in the summer.

But those suffering from ostraconophobia (that’s fear of shellfish to you and me) needn’t be left gasping for air, because invertebrate expert Paul Clark at the Natural History Museum in London has branded the photo a hoax.

""I had a good giggle about it - it's ridiculous,"" he said, adding that it ""is definitely not real.""

Here's why:

1. The largest crabs in the world are thought to be Japanese spider crabs - also known as Macrocheira kaempferi - which can grow to the size of a small car with an impressive leg span of up to twelve feet. However, these crabs live in deep, cold water around Japan and are a completely different shape.

2. Another huge crab with a more similar shape to the one in the picture is the Tasmanian giant crab, also known as Pseudocarcinus gigas. These are the world's heaviest crabs but they reside in the southern waters of Australia at depths of 20-820 metres.

3. Mr Clark did not think that the crab was a representation of Cancer pagurus, also known as the edible crab, either because of a slightly different shape. And anyway, these tend to only grow to a maximum of 30 centimetres.

4. Instead, he said that the crab looked more to him like a shore crab (Carcinus maenas) - cleverly Photoshopped on to a satellite image. ""A hoax is an understatement. A shore crab gets up to two inches - if you're lucky!"" he said.

5. Internet hoax debunkers have also been on the case, with a user from ThatsNonsense.com pointing out that the the image of the harbour was taken from Bing maps, sans crustacean in the original satellite photograph, of course.","1"

"Weather Channel’s Mike Seidel was not caught with his pants down","The Weather Channel’s Mike Seidel has taken a lot of ribbing about what he was doing live on network TV this weekend.  But he didn’t do what online news sites and YouTubers suggest he did.



Seidel was reporting from Sugar Mountain, North Carolina Saturday where an early season storm dropped 10 inches of snow. NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt introduced Seidel while the meteorologist’s back was turned to the camera. Seidel was hunched over fiddling with something. To an awful lot of people who saw Holt dump out of the live shot, it appeared Seidel was zipping up his pants, having answered nature’s call.


The NY Daily news headline taunted, “NBC meteorologist Mike Seidel appears to relieve himself during broadcast.”

But that is not what happened at all, said Shirley Powell, the Weather Channel’s spokesperson. Seidel, she said, was using his cell phone as an IFB (that is short for interruptible feedback) which is how reporters in the field get their cues from the control room. The phone lost its signal just as the anchor was introducing the live shot. Powell told Poynter.org that Seidel yanked off his gloves, turned from the howling wind and was dialing the IFB when Holt tossed to him. Since Seidel didn’t have a phone signal, he didn’t know he was on the air. While he frantically dialed the phone, Seidel tucked his heavy gloves between his knees to keep them from blowing away. When he finished dialing, he yanked his gloves back on and turned to the camera but Holt was already calling off the shot and moving on. Seidel was left hanging in the winter wind.

“I’m glad for you to tell what really happened,” Powell told me.

“Social media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology,” Williams said. “The intrepid and fearless Weather Channel meteorologist was the victim of some wild misinformation,” he continued.

"Dog Found Abandoned With Suitcase Filled With His Belongings","A dog was found abandoned at a Scottish train station next to a suitcase filled with it's belongings and now the local animal welfare charity are looking for tips into who is the neglectful owner.

The dog, a male shar-pei named Kai, was found sitting with a leash attached to a banister at the Ayr railway station on Jan. 2, according to the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

""Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature,"" Scottish SPCA Inspector Stewart Taylor said in the group's release.

Amazing Animals From Around the World
The group reported that the suitcase contained a dog bowl, food, a pillow and toy -- although that doesn't clear the owner from wrongdoing.

Abandoning an animal is an offense in Scotland and, if they are able to determine who left the dog in the station, that person or persons could be banned from owning animals for life.

""Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible,"" Taylor said.

Officials were able to determine the dog's name because the animal had been microchipped by a previous owner. When they contacted that individual, he reported that he had sold the dog in 2013 but did not have any information on the new owner.

Taylor said that the group will care for the dog until they find an owner for Kai.","1"

Staff now face days of work to whittle down the flood of applications to find Kai one new owner after poignant photos of him went viral.

Assistant manager Katrina Cavanagh said: 'We've had offers from America, the Philippines, Canada and England and we're trying to work our way through them.

'We've had good responses in the past but this is off the scale. We've never had offers from the other side of the world before.

Kai has been compared to Paddington bear after his ordeal, which has prompted an investigation by the animal welfare charity.

Until it is complete, he will not be handed over to a new family, so it could be some time before he is adopted.

He may also need surgery for entropions, inward-curling eyelids, which the charity will pay for.

Ms Cavanagh added: 'He's loved the attention. He's been in and out of his kennel so many times being filmed and having his picture taken. He's a very happy boy and he's behaved perfectly.

"EBay appears to be planning an Apple Watch app","Forget health or messaging. The forthcoming Apple Watch could end up being a lynchpin for e-commerce.

EBay, whose website allows people to buy and sell all sorts of things both new and old, is seeking an iOS Engineer/Architect who can work on “elegant solutions for the Apple Watch that will complement our core iOS eBay app,” according to a job posting from the company.

The listing was first published on eBay’s job page in November, but it has been getting more attention thanks to its appearance on LinkedIn this month, according to a report today from AppleInsider.

E-commerce companies like Flipkart have developed apps for Android Wear watches. Now, as Apple gears up to start shipping the Apple Watch in April, e-commerce companies will presumably develop for it, too.

Apple first announced the WatchKit software development kit for Apple Watch in November.

According to the ad, the ideal candidate will “design and implement elegant solutions for the Apple Watch that will complement our core iOS eBay app.” That seems to indicate that whatever presence the eBay app has on the Apple Watch, it will tie into the core iPhone app.

What kind of functionality will the eBay Apple Watch app have?

"Research Medical Center denies reports that a patient has Ebola","KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Research Medical Center is waiting for test results after concern that a patient might have a contagious disease.  The hospital says some local reports that the patient has Ebola are false.

Research Medical Center says that patient came to its Brookside campus emergency department Saturday for treatment.

“Somebody went to an ER with a high fever and a history of having recently been to Nigeria,” said Jeff Hershberger, the spokesman for the KCMO Health Department.

He says because Ebola is so high-profile right now, they don’t want to rule it out quite yet.

“The patient has been isolated, however, at this point, because there’s been no development of new symptoms, it’s highly unlike that Ebola is the diagnosis,” added Hershberger.

According to a statement from Research Medical Center, like hospitals across the United States, it has standard infectious disease precautions and is well-equipped and well-prepared to implement them as necessary.

“There’s a wide umbrella of things that it could be,” Hershberger said, “We want to make sure, looking at that entire umbrella, that we are not ignoring something.”

The hospital does not believe the patient has Ebola, and says the patient is being treated for another illness. Hershberger says regardless, Ebola should not be a big concern.

“It’s very unlikely they will even be exposed to it, let alone contract it,” Hershberger said, “You cannot catch Ebola unless you touch the bodily fluids of somebody who has Ebola.”

The health department says it should know the patient’s diagnosis by Monday. It also says that Research Medical Center is taking the appropriate steps when it comes to dealing with infectious diseases.","1"

Via KCTV - 5:
The person who was rushed to Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri Saturday night is a man - not a woman as previously reported, and hospital officials now say the patient is not being treated for Ebola. 
HCA Midwest assistant vice president Chris Hamele said that the patient does not have the symptom profile of virus and is being treated appropriately for his condition.
Last night, it was reported that all or part of the medical facility was under quarantine. It is still unknown what the Nigerian man is suffering from or if anyone else is sick.
This afternoon when Breitbart News checked, the apartment building was no longer cordoned off.
Kansas City Health Department spokesman Jeff Hershberger said health department officials are monitoring the situation and and are in a state of awareness because of the recent lone Ebola patient diagnosed in Texas.","1"
"Despite no Ebola case in Kansas City, the rumor goes viral","Rumors of Ebola turned out to be far more contagious than the virus itself this weekend as online media whipped up a feverish story, later disproven, of a suspected Ebola case in Kansas City.

After appearing on a local blog and a Wichita television website Saturday night, the rumor went viral, spreading to such national outlets as Breitbart.com.

Then on Sunday afternoon, a spokeswoman for Research Medical Center issued a statement:

“We have seen online reports that a patient at Research Medical Center is suspected of having Ebola. These reports are inaccurate. Research Medical Center is caring for a patient who presented to our Brookside Campus emergency department, however, the patient does not have the symptom profile of Ebola.”

That was followed Monday by a statement from the Kansas City Health Department: “The Health Department has ruled out the presence of Ebola in Kansas City.”

“There was a social media frenzy about the possibility of Ebola in Kansas City,” said Jeff Hershberger, a department spokesman. “We’re still exploring how this happened.”

Hospitals and the general public have been on edge since an Ebola case was diagnosed last week at a hospital in Dallas. Thomas Eric Duncan is in critical condition at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The hospital’s failure to recognize that Duncan may have had Ebola during an earlier visit to its emergency room has heightened vigilance further.

Details about what happened Saturday in Kansas City are still unclear, but a feverish man was taken to Research Medical Center’s Brookside Campus on Saturday night. The man apparently was from Nigeria, a country that has had Ebola cases but is not among the three African countries engulfed in the current epidemic.

The patient’s travel history and fever “triggered them to look at things that included Ebola,” Hershberger said.

Kansas City police said they received a call Saturday night from a nurse who told them the hospital was under lockdown because of suspicions about the patient. The police decided to block access to the patient’s apartment in the 3600 block of East Meyer Boulevard and to keep the vehicle used to take him to the hospital under observation.

“Neighbors saw (the police activity) and got worried and contacted the media,” Hershberger said.

Meantime, the blog TonysKansasCity.com posted the line: “First suspected report of Ebola in Kansas City!!” Tony Botello, who writes the blog, later revised that report.

KCTV-5 broadcast a story Saturday night about the apartment building being locked down because of a potentially contagious disease but never mentioned Ebola, said Darrin McDonald, the station’s vice president and general manager.

If a Wichita station reported it was a case of the Ebola virus, “they connected dots that we never did,” McDonald said.

Gordon Beedle, a news producer at KWCH-12 in Wichita, said the station received information from KCTV about the story and posted its own version online. Beedle said he couldn’t recall exactly what that story said and couldn’t trace it Monday night.

Sunday night, KCTV reported that Kansas City health officials said it was not Ebola.

But on Saturday night, others told a different story, said Christine Hamele, a spokeswoman for HCA Midwest Health, which operates Research Medical Center.

“I was made aware of erroneous reports of a suspected Ebola case in the Kansas City area,” she said. “What was clear to me by 11 p.m. (Saturday) was that none of the information … was accurate.”

Hamele said the patient was transferred from Research’s Brookside Campus to the main hospital, where he was placed in isolation. He responded well to treatment and was released Monday, she said.

“A lot of us are on an extra alert because of what happened in Dallas,” Hershberger said. “What happened this weekend was a situation we would prefer to what happened in Dallas. We prefer extra vigilance to not enough vigilance.”

"Hospital: Man not being treated for Ebola in Kansas City","KANSAS CITY, MO (KCTV) -
A man rushed to a Kansas City-area hospital Saturday is not being treated for Ebola, hospital officials say.

HCA Midwest assistant vice president Chris Hamele said that the patient does not have the symptom profile of virus and is being treated appropriately for his condition.

It is unknown at this time what the patient is suffering from or if anyone else is sick.

This comes after a Kansas City apartment building in the 3600 block of East Meyer Boulevard was sealed off about 9:30 p.m. Saturday when the man who lived there became seriously ill.

Paramedics rushed the man to Research Medical Center Brookside Campus about 9:30 p.m. It was then when all or part of the medical facility was quarantined, a source close to the situation told KCTV5 News.

""Like hospitals across the United States, Research Medical Center has standard infectious disease precautions and we are well-equipped and well-prepared to implement them as necessary,"" Hamele said. ""As healthcare providers, our job is to care for sick patients and we will continue to provide high-quality care to our community as we always have.""

Kansas City Health Department spokesman Jeff Hershberger said health department officials are monitoring the situation and are in a state of awareness because of the recent lone Ebola patient diagnosed in Texas.

Chris Hernandez, a spokesperson for the city of Kansas City, said they wanted to take an abundance of caution to avoid a Dallas situation and Sunday he's been told that it's considered ""extremely unlikely"" to be Ebola.

Hamele said Sunday that the patient has been responding well to treatment that day and was upgraded to good condition.","1"
"KC hospital: Patient does not have symptom profile of Ebola","KANSAS CITY, Mo. —Research Medical Center said a patient who came to its Brookside Campus emergency department for treatment does not have the symptom profile of Ebola.

The hospital issued the statement to stop rumors and online reports that the patient was being treated for the disease.

""These reports are inaccurate,"" said HCA Midwest Health spokeswoman Chris Hamele.

She said the patient was taken to the hospital's main campus, where he being treated appropriately for his illness and is responding well in good condition. The man had one of the symptoms of Ebola and had recently traveled to Nigeria.

The symptoms of the disease can include a high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding and bruising.

Local health officials have said it's extremely unlikely that the patient has Ebola.

Family members with patients in the emergency room at Research Medical Center said it was business as usual there on Sunday.

""If it's something we should have been concerned about, I think they would have said something,"" said patient Collette Harvin.

Marcus Mitchem, who was visiting a patient, said Ebola is a scary thing to think about.

""The most concerning thing about the Ebola virus is no known cure. You get it, you die. That causes concern for everybody,"" he said.

Several Americans who contracted Ebola while in Africa have returned to the United States and responded well to treatment, in part due to safety protocols at American hospitals.

Hamele said Research Medical Center has standard infectious disease precautions, and is well-equipped and well prepared to implement them.

""As health care providers, our job is to care for sick patients and we will continue to provide high quality care to our community as we always have,"" Hamele said.

Harvin said she's not really afraid about Ebola.

""We have measures here. We have medicine,"" she said. ""If we were in Africa or something like that, I'd be a little more worried.""

The Kansas City Health Department said in a tweet that local hospitals have procedures to protect patients, staff and visitors from infectious diseases. It said it has complete faith that Research Medical Center is taking the appropriate steps.

""It's important to remember,"" the Health Department tweeted. ""You cannot get Ebola unless you handle bodily fluids of someone who has Ebola.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reminds the public that it's not spread through casual contact or the air.

More than 3,000 people have died from the outbreak. About 2,000 U.S. troops are already helping Ebola-affected countries. On Friday, the Pentagon announced that number could grow to 4,000.","1"
"Sick Kansas City man said not to have Ebola, U.S. plans new steps to fight virus","KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Kansas City health officials said a man held in isolation at a local hospital over the weekend was not infected with the Ebola virus. Officials hope to sooth nerves as fears about the deadly virus spread across the country, even though the virus itself has not.

“We have ruled out any Ebola case in Kansas City,” Kansas City Health Department Director Dr. Rex Archer told reporters on Monday. He said the man, who had recently traveled to Nigeria, did not possess the symptom profile for the deadly virus beyond a high fever and had not been in direct contact with anyone who had the disease during his travels.

No Ebola blood test was done, Dr. Archer said, because the feared symptoms never materialized.

The case marked the second known Ebola scare in the Kansas City area , as fears of the virus have built while an American fights for his life against it in Dallas.

At the White House Monday, President Barack Obama urged calm and outlined several steps the administration is taking to contain the virus in Africa and fight it there.

“The CDC is familiar with dealing with infectious diseases and viruses like this,” the president said. “We know what has to be done, and we have the medical infrastructure to do it.”

Monday morning, Kansas Senator Jerry Moran sent a letter to the CDC director , urging greater screening at U.S. ports of entry, including airports.

This afternoon, President Obama said such steps are under consideration.

“We're also going to be looking at protocols to do additional passenger screening both at the source and here in the United States,” Obama said. “All of these things make me confident that here in the United States, the chances of an outbreak-of an epidemic here- are extraordinarily low.”","1"

"Purdon Ebola Hoax: ‘Texas Town Quarantined After Family Of Five Test Positive For The Ebola Virus’ Article is Fake","A report that says a family in the town of Purdon, Texas has got the Ebola virus and the town was quarantined is fake.

Thomas Eric Duncan and Nina Pham have in fact be diagnosed with Ebola, with Duncan dying earlier this month. Duncan traveled from Liberia, a country that’s been hard-hit by the virus, to the US and he apparently came into contact with Pham.

"Elon University has not banned the term ‘freshman,’ despite rumors","ELON, N.C. – A recent rumor claims that Elon University has banned the term “freshman” because it’s sexist. But the rumor is not true, according to the university.

A junior student at Elon University recently wrote an article for the College Fix, a website for students, claiming the school dropped the term and replaced it with “first year.”

The post claims it was an official move made by the school this fall to promote inclusivity, diversity, and ensure the campus does not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students. The National Review Online also picked up the story.

The article claimed the school implemented the term “first-year” in everything from its website to orientation workshops.

But Dan Anderson, vice president of university communications at Elon, told the Burlington Times-News there is no ban or new policy.

Anderson said the university uses the term “first-year” because it applies to more students than the term “freshman.”

He said the school uses “first-year” to describe any student in the first year at Elon, as opposed to a recent high school graduate.

“Elon has done what most schools have done and gone to using ‘first-year’ more frequently because ‘first-year’ encompasses more than just traditional freshmen,” Anderson said. “We still use ‘freshman’ when it refers to traditional students who come right out of high school.”

The student who wrote the original story said she became curious when she was writing a story for the school newspaper and her editor changed the word “freshman” to first-year.”

She said she was surprised her story got as much attention as it did and hopes it didn’t put the school in a bad light.

"At Elon, ‘first-year’ has not replaced ‘freshman,’ university says","Elon University has not banned the use of the word freshman, and there is no policy dictating that the school uses the term “first-year” in place of “freshman,” according to Dan Anderson, vice president of University Communications.

The university has received national media attention since a student from Elon reported that the school is dropping the word freshman and replacing it with first year. The story, originally published on The College Fix, found its way to FOX News and The National Review Online, where the word “drop” changed to “ban.”

The university uses first-year in its admissions process because the types of students coming into college are not all traditional students who have graduated from high school.

“At almost every college, admissions is moving to this term because it encompasses traditional students and also includes transfers, spring admits, gap semester students, part-time students and non-traditional age students,” Anderson said. “It describes people spending their first year at Elon.”

Anderson explained that the term isn’t Elon’s alone. Duke University, the University of North Carolina system and High Point all use first-year on their admissions websites. They all refer to “The First Year Experience.” The U.S. News and World Report publishes rankings for the schools with the best first-year experience programming.

While there is no official policy on the word, first-year Blair Foreman said her orientation leader always called the group just that, and most of her professors use the term as well. She understands why the university would use it in place of freshman, but is not offended by the word.

“I get the intentions behind it,” Foreman said. “Everyone is on the same totem pole, but I don’t mind either way.”

Sophomore Tyson Glover spent his first semester at Elon in the GAP program and said he enjoyed being called  first-year rather than freshman. He said it made his transition into college easier.

“Coming into Elon January was different,” Glover said. “There’s not a lot going on. First year is an all-encompassing term, and made our transition smoother. It helped us get in the same boat as the rest of our class.”

According to the original article, Leigh-Anne Royster, director of the Inclusive Community Well-Being, said the term “freshman” may contribute to sexual violence. Anderson said Royster was answering generally why people might not like to use the term “freshman,” not referring to why Elon University does not use the term.

Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, corroborated Royster’s comments in the article.

“The student asked what the primary reason was for changing freshman to first year, presuming there was a change,” Anderson said. Zaiser explained that in general, some consider it a sexist term and that it is not a completely accurate description of the incoming classes.

There are some students who prefer freshman to first year, though. Firs- years Mackenzie Franklin and Daniel Maclaury prefer the word freshman, saying it is a more traditional term and more natural for them.

“First year makes it seem like I won’t graduate in four years,” Franklin said. “But I do use them interchangeably.”

"No, ESPN is not having an all-male domestic violence panel tonight","The following is one of the most unusual media stories of the last year.

On Friday, Esquire Magazine posted a blistering piece bashing ESPN written by the publication’s news editor Ben Collins.  It was entitled “ESPN has a problem with women.”

While the column centered on the suspensions of Bill Simmons and Stephen A. Smith, the lead produced some exclusive details about coverage plans for Monday Night Football.  Namely, the network would be having a domestic violence panel featuring 11 different voices.  All men.  Our bold emphasis has been added.

On Monday night, a panel on a two-hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will, among other things, address domestic abuse. This panel will discuss, once again, the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman.
The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis.

Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24.

When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they’ll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.

These people are not allowed at the table.

How Collins got that information, whether through his own sources or ESPN itself, was never shared with Esquire readers.  Nevertheless, the “11 men” theme kept coming back throughout his piece as a tentpole of outrage.

The existence of ESPN’s 11 men domestic violence panel, and the anger towards it, spread slowly throughout the weekend.  Deadspin has a nice recap of how far the story reached as it was noticed on Twitter and reblogged across the internet, with one feminist organization even putting the network on blast based on the Esquire article in a press release.

Of course, ESPN is not having an 11 man domestic violence panel tonight.  The network has explicitly and publicly called the Esquire story false as documented below.

But just examining this story from the outset, there was plenty to be skeptical about in Esquire’s story.

First of all, ESPN has covered domestic violence and the NFL at length while involving women in the discussion.  Jane McManus has been a consistent presence on ESPN airwaves and ESPN has a deep bench of female commentators that have talked about the issue on the air.  You can criticize sports networks for not involving women in more prominent ways, but ESPN at least appears to be trying to make an effort here.  McManus defended the network on Twitter:



Second, in light of those tweets, there’s no mention of Suzy Kolber – who will be one of the hosts on Monday Night Countdown tonight.  If there’s any panel discussion happening tonight, wouldn’t she be involved?

Third, it’s easy to make fun of ESPN and the gratuitously absurd amount of NFL analysts the network employs.  But who in their right mind would conduct an 11 person panel on a topic like domestic violence?  That’s not something that even Nancy Grace and the cable news networks would be silly enough to do.

If we’re to believe this Esquire story, Chris Berman would be moderating an 11 person panel discussion on domestic violence including everyone from the game announcers to reporters.  It’s nonsensical.  Not even ESPN would be that dense.

Bristol began the counter-offensive today.  The network released their coverage plans for Monday Night Countdown tonight.  And in a move straight out of the ESPN PR Playbook, they also highlighted women’s contributions to their coverage of the NFL domestic violence crisis.

A rare public statement from John Wildhack, one of the highest on the ESPN Executive Food Chain, also disputed the Esquire report/column/rant/guesswork…

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown.  We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting.  ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage.  Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms,  including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more. 

So how did this happen?  It’s simple.  Haphazard and reckless writing at Esquire gradually began to be taken as fact.

There never were plans for an 11 men panel to discuss domestic violence on Monday Night Countdown.  Collins merely listed the talent that would be working the show and assumed the topic would come up at some point during the evening in an unbelievable failure in communication through the written word.

Collins explained his position in greater detail on his Twitter page:


That’s a pretty far cry from what Collins actually wrote in his article which made it abundantly clear there would be a special domestic violence panel with enough men to field an entire football team. “Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN.”  There’s no ambiguity in that statement.

100 out of 100 people would read that sentence and think ESPN would be televising a large all-male panel discussion specifically focused on domestic violence tonight.  How does someone who is a news editor at a major publication blur the lines of truth and fiction so badly?




Had Collins stuck with that last tweet he would have had the basis for a decent column and a valid criticism worth raising.  But because of the overall sloppiness of the Esquire piece, that point was missed entirely.  Instead, a lot of people have wasted a lot of time talking about an 11 men domestic violence panel that never existed.","1"
"That ESPN Domestic Violence Panel You Keep Hearing About Isn't Real","On Friday, Esquire.com's Ben Collins wrote a blog post in which some awkward phrasing made it appear as though tonight's episode of Monday Night Countdown on ESPN will feature a special panel discussion on domestic violence.

Here's how his post starts:

On Monday night, a panel on a two-hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will, among other things, address domestic abuse. This panel will discuss, once again, the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman.

Collins's outrage at ESPN's failure to include any women in a discussion dedicated to domestic violence was shared by many, and word of the ""panel discussion"" began to spread across Twitter:









And then there were a lot of other blogposts, piggybacking off of Collins's, with headlines like these:

ESPN Doesn't Get It: They Ignore Women's Voices In Public Dialog About Domestic Violence
ESPN's Domestic Violence Panel Is Missing Something Important
11 Men and 0 Women on Tonight's ESPN Domestic Violence Panel
ESPN's Domestic Abuse Tonight Panel Will Be 100% Dudes
ESPN to save NFL's image with all-male domestic abuse discussion
And then feminist organization UltraViolet blasted this press release to various media outlets:

UltraViolet Calls on ESPN to Include Women in Discussion About Domestic Violence

Statement from Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of UltraViolet, on ESPN's announcement that a 11 man panel will discuss domestic violence during their Monday Night Football pre-game roundtable:

""By having a roundtable on domestic violence and not including any women, much less survivors of domestic violence, the panel is the height of ignorance by ESPN. ESPN must be getting their PR advice from their buddies at the NFL. Both the NFL and ESPN seem to greatly misunderstand the problem they are trying to address and the millions of people's lives it effects.""

While it's good to see ESPN taking on the issue of domestic violence within the NFL tonight, we strongly believe that they should also include the voices of women and survivors of domestic violence at the table. With nearly 45% of NFL fans and viewers being women, including women at the table not only would add to the discussion but would address the realities of their audience and the issue at hand.""
But tonight's episode of Monday Night Countdown is just going to be a regular episode, and will not be featuring any special discussion about domestic violence. We reached out to ESPN PR, who told us that talk of the special panel was ""false info"" and that tonight will feature a ""regular episode of Countdown hosted by Suzy Kolber.""

There are certainly criticisms to be made of Monday Night Countdown fielding such a dude-heavy panel that is painfully ill-equipped to speak intelligently about any issue of substance, as has been proven in the past. Tonight, however, it's highly unlikely that domestic violence will even come up.

Update: And here is a statement from ESPN:

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight's Monday Night Countdown.

On Monday, ESPN’s John Wildhack, executive vice president of programming and production released a statement refuting Esquire’s original report that the network scheduled any sort of domestic violence panel discussion.

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.

ESPN published a blog post highlighting reporting on domestic abuse by its female staffers since the Ray Rice scandal broke last month.

ESPN also posted a list of highlights for tonight’s “Monday Night Football” broadcast, which includes no discussion about domestic violence.

ESPN reporter Jane McManus took to Twitter to debunk Esquire’s domestic violence panel story.

ESPN is about to release a statement. I'll go through a few points here. There was never a domestic violence panel planned for MNF tonight.

Since the Rice story broke, ESPN has featured several women prominently, including myself, @katefagan3, @SarahSpain @jemelehill etc.

Tonight's regular MNF panel will be hosted by Suzy Kolber. It was never meant to be a single-issue discussion of domestic violence.

Esquire did not immediately return a request for comment.","1"
"There was never a panel discussion on domestic violence planned for ESPN’s ‘Monday Night Football’ pregame show","ESPN’s “Monday Night Football” will not be featuring a discussion in which an all-male panel discusses domestic violence.

In fact, the telecast of the game between the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs will feature just a regular pregame show. There was never, the network says, a panel discussion about the topic planned for tonight.

The network was hammered with calls after an Esquire blog post (“ESPN Has a Problem with Women”) indicated that an all-male lineup would debate the topic, which has been a hot once since the second Ray Rice video surfaced three weeks ago. On Monday, in the third game since the explosive video triggered the NFL’s domestic violence crisis, “it’s a normal lineup for ‘Monday Night Football,’” according to Chris LaPlaca, ESPN’s senior vice-president of corporate communications.

That lineup, of course, includes Suzy Kolber, who hosts the two-hour “Monday Night Countdown” show, and Lisa Salters, reporter and sideline reporter. In a statement on the matter, John Wildhack, executive vice-president of programming and production, said:

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown.

"Ferguson Protester's Photo Gets Edited Into Racist Meme, Goes Viral","When Jermell Hasson agreed to let Riverfront Times take his photo for a story about Ferguson protesters, he had no idea someone would later turn it into a viral and inflammatory meme.
Hasson carried a sign in front of the Ferguson police station that read: ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he leaves home. #blacklivesmatter #stayhuman""

Months later, a doctored photo of him holding a sign that says, ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store,"" has gone viral.

""That's slander to my character,"" Hasson tells Daily RFT. ""You can tell it's obviously been photoshopped. It was a horrible job.""

Imgur user Bdawgid says he's the Photoshop wizard behind the altered photo, which was posted to the photo-sharing site on November 27. Bdawgid writes on Imgur that he created the image because, ""it captured mine, and many others, frustration with this whole situation.""

More than 28,000 people shared the faked photo after Jim Gleason, a Maplewood native who's owned a south-county sign business for almost twenty years, posted it on Facebook with the (very incorrect) description: ""You can't make this up!!!!!""

More than 28,000 people shared this doctored photo.
Gleason wouldn't tell Daily RFT what motivated him to share the photo, which refers to the death of Michael Brown, who was recorded on surveillance cameras stealing from a convenience store and was later fatally shot by then-Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.
""I certainly didn't mean any harm by it,"" Gleason says. He says he found the doctored image on Facebook and took the image down after getting ""an onslaught of emails"" saying it was fake. ""We absolutely, unequivocally did not edit it.""

Riverfront Times reporter Mitch Ryals took the original photo of Hasson, 27, in September in front of the police station.

The original photo.
Hasson told Daily RFT in September he'd been sleeping in a parking lot across the street from the police station for weeks to peacefully protest Brown's death.
""We were literally on this lot for 24 hours for that whole month,"" Hasson told Daily RFT in September. ""I'm not saying here for an hour then going home. Twenty-four [hours] we were in this lot peacefully protesting. We've been rained on for a full week on this lot waiting for the sun to come out in the morning to dry us out.""

This week, Hasson tells Daily RFT he thinks the doctored photo is a sign that Ferguson protests are having an effect on the way people think.

""It shows that we are making a difference out here,"" Hasson says. ""For someone who has nothing better to do with their life than photoshop a sign, it shows me that we haven't been out here since August for no reason. They're trying to stop the movement, which they can't.""

Hasson says he has a message for Gleason and the thousands of people who shared the fake photo: ""Remove the hatred out of your heart, and come and see what we're doing for yourself.""

Gleason says he is surprised and saddened by the backlash to the photo he posted because ""qualified investigators at all levels of government"" concluded that Brown robbed the convenience store before his death.

""It appears that this young man robbed a store, assaulted a police officer, and it is just surprising to me the uprising when the physical evidence seems to be overwhelmingly in support of the police officer's actions,"" Gleason says.

People who objected to the provocative photo posted to the Facebook page for Gleason's business, Sign-A-Rama St. Louis, to warn customers.

""Makes the BEST racist memes on Facebook,"" one person sarcastically wrote on the shop's Facebook page. ""Gives good discounts to whites, charges darkies extra. Highly recommended to any whites in St. Louis looking for a good white pride meme.""

"Dumb Racists Photoshop Ferguson Protester Into Awful Viral Meme","Jermell Hasson spent his summer sleeping in a parking lot in Ferguson to join the protests over Michael Brown's shooting by police. Hasson's reward was to become racist America's favorite meme, after a doctored image of him was shared thousands of times across the internet's dark, sticky id-corners.

Riverfront Times photographer Mitch Ryals snapped an innocuous shot in September of Hasson carrying a sign with fellow protesters that read ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he leaves home,"" with the hashtags ""#blacklivesmatter"" and ""#stayhuman"":

Dumb Racists Photoshop Ferguson Protester Into Awful Viral Meme

Opponents of the protests did not take Hasson's advice. Instead, the Times reports, its image of him went viral after his sign was photoshopped to read ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store"":

Brown was suspected of helping to knock over a convenience store before the confrontation with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson that led to the teen's death.

Riverfront Times caught up with one local man, Jim Gleason, who was apparently one of the first to share the made-up image on Facebook with the note ""You can't make this up!!!!"" (It was subsequently shared more than 28,000 times.) Gleason explained to the Times what was apparently self-evident to him and other fans of the image—that suspected robbers of convenience stores should be summarily shot:

Gleason says he is surprised and saddened by the backlash to the photo he posted because ""qualified investigators at all levels of government"" concluded that Brown robbed the convenience store before his death.

""It appears that this young man robbed a store, assaulted a police officer, and it is just surprising to me the uprising when the physical evidence seems to be overwhelmingly in support of the police officer's actions,"" Gleason says.
A handful of critics have taken to the Facebook page of Gleason's St. Louis business—a signmaking business—to express their frustrations.

Hasson called the image-doctoring a ""slander,"" but he seems to be taking it in stride. ""It shows that we are making a difference out here,"" he told the Times:

For someone who has nothing better to do with their life than photoshop a sign, it shows me that we haven't been out here since August for no reason. They're trying to stop the movement, which they can't.","1"
"Rumor Fatigue Sets In at False Alarms of Castro’s Death","MIAMI — The bulletin now falls squarely in the pantheon of unconfirmed phenomena, along with U.F.O.s, sightings of the Loch Ness monster and the breakup of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie:

Fidel Castro is dead.

Sooner or later, it will be true. But on Friday, for the umpteenth time, Miami was distracted by the rumor that Mr. Castro, 88, who has survived revolution, assassination attempts, countless cigars, substantial stress, a fall after leaving a stage and a life-threatening stomach ailment, had finally succumbed.

“Hope springs eternal,” said James Cason, the former head of the United States Interests Section in Cuba from 2002 to 2005 and now the mayor of Coral Gables, a wealthy enclave in Miami-Dade County. “He must have died 20 times since the time I went to Cuba.”

Cuban-Americans gathered in the usual spot, the Versailles restaurant on Calle Ocho, and other Cuban establishments to ponder the possibility that this time, maybe, maybe, it would be true. But even here in a city still fixated by Mr. Castro, rumor fatigue was obvious. Versailles had put its Fidel-is-dead game plan into action — assigning some parking spots to local TV and radio stations, but few showed up

It was no different at La Carreta, a restaurant in Westchester, Fla., a Cuban-American stronghold.

“There is always doubt about this; the joke is on us,” said Manolo Alvarez, 75, a retired painter, laughing as he held court with his friends in front of the Cuban cafecito counter. “But eventually it will happen. No one is immortal. And he will join the devil.”

Castro death alerts come fast and frequently these days. His age, ill health, long absence from public view and society’s shift from old-school rumor mill to hyperspeed Twitter feed make even debunked stories effortlessly spreadable. In fact, determining the provenance of each rumor has become a kind of modern-day parlor game.

In this case, the story probably stemmed from a simple mix-up, the death of a lesser-known namesake in a faraway country: Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, Raila Odinga, died on Sunday and was eulogized on Thursday. A similar mistake occurred in August 1997, when a Cuban revolutionary figure, Rene Orley Sanchez Castro, died in Cuba, spawning a swirl of speculation around the world.

Like most of the past false reports, the one on Friday was bolstered by tantalizing circumstantial droplets. The last time Mr. Castro was seen in public was Jan. 9, 2014, making Friday the first anniversary of his disappearance. And Mr. Castro, never at a loss for words, had failed to comment about December’s announcements by his younger brother, Raúl, and President Obama that the United States and Cuba would resume diplomatic ties.

There was also word on Friday of an abruptly scheduled news conference and chatter — true or not — about how the major roads to a famous revolutionary cemetery in Santiago de Cuba, where Mr. Castro reportedly will be buried, were being repaired.

The likeliest explanation for Mr. Castro’s absence is that he is, in fact, too mentally and physically frail to be seen or to speak.

“We don’t know what his physical state is because they never let you know,” Mr. Cason said of Cuban officials. “But they want him to be remembered as strong and vigorous. They don’t want him to be seen.”

Tales of Mr. Castro’s demise have surfaced for decades. In 1986, the State Department had to beat back a flurry of reports and questions from Miami about Mr. Castro’s apparent death. The sources of the speculation were varied and dubious: A ham radio operator in Havana, a nurse in Cuba who telephoned a friend in Miami, a report by an astrologer.

More rumors followed, off and on, and then accelerated after Mr. Castro vanished for a stretch in 2006 and, once again, after he relinquished power to his brother Raúl in 2008. Through the years, Mr. Castro has been rumored to have been stricken by heart attacks, brain hemorrhages, strokes and cancer. He has alternately delighted in and derided the many attempts to “kill him off early,” as he joked once in 1997.

“Now that our enemies have prematurely declared me dying or dead, I am happy to send my compatriots and friends around the world this short film material,” Mr. Castro said in 2006, after his absence.

In Miami, his death, when it is finally confirmed, will be historically momentous and, for most, cause for jubilation. The city will dust off its ever-evolving contingency plans. Even some private schools have early dismissal emails to parents at the ready.

But, to a certain extent, Mr. Castro’s death will also be anticlimactic. Years ago, his death was seen as the necessary prelude to a democratic Cuba and a return home for tens of thousands of exiles. With Raúl Castro firmly in place, that is no longer the case.

“If this had happened at the height of his power, or even when he was just fading, it would be different,” said Peter Hakim, a Cuba expert at the Inter-American Dialogue center in Washington. “This was almost a personal battle not to let Fidel win. Now, I think people are beginning to accept that Fidel has won. He will go to his grave with the government intact and the U.S. backing down from its unalterable commitment to unseat the regime he installed.”","1"
"Fidel Castro Dead? Yes, He Is… But The Cuban Leader Is Alive, Death Rumors Proven False","Is Fidel Castro dead? Yes, a man named “Fidel Castro” has died, but he’s not the famous Castro you might be thinking of. The prospect that the leader of Cuba might have died is circulating on the internet, and the rumors claim Fidel Castro’s death was supposed be announced at an official conference, according to the Castro health rumors, but already Cuba has denied these rumors.

In a related report by the Inquisitr, it’s claimed that Ian Fleming, the author of the famous James Bond series, helped former President Kennedy to hatch a Fidel Castro assassination plot.

According to the el Nuevo Herald, the rumors claimed Fidel Castro dead because a man named Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of an important politician in Kenya, died over the weekend at the age of 14 years old.

“Castro Odinga was the son of Raila Odinga, the main opposition leader in Kenya and was considered a possible successor to his father. It is possible that his death and his name have confused many users of Twitter, and these have begun to spread the word about the supposed death of the Cuban leader.”

Kenyan police are currently investigating Odinga’s death, and these headlines may have encouraged rumors about the Cuban leader.

According to Laiguana TV, it’s also possible that a blog by Yusnaby Perez may have sparked rumors that claimed Fidel Castro dead because he had not been in public in many months.

“How strange! It is the first year since I can remember the anniversary of the Revolution that Fidel does not appear.”

Thursday marked a year since the former Cuban president made a public appearance. Castro has apparently received foreign dignitaries at his home in Havana, but has not commented publicly on the recent changes between Cuba and the United States that was announced on December 17, 2014.

The rumors were increased even further when Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on Fidel Castro’s death. The newspaper quickly retracted its report, but not before the alleged “news” about Castro went viral.

Because of these rumors several media outlets in Venezuela and Cuba claimed the Cuban government planned on calling a press conference to discuss Fidel Castro’s heath condition. But an official from the International Press Centre (CPI), the department Cuban Foreign Ministry serving foreign media, says this rumor is false, saying,

“That is false. No press conference was convened, no.”

In addition, Castro’s influential nephew, Alejandro Castro Espin, who is currently in Greece, told a radio station his uncle is “in good health” and there’s no reason to speculate about Castro’s death.","1"
"Rob O'Neill may have killed bin Laden, but didn't take out gangster intruders","BUTTE — Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington is a wanted man in these parts. Too bad neither the position nor the man exist.

A satirical story about Rob O’Neill posted on the Internet has prompted everyone from Associated Press reporters to Louisiana law enforcement officers to call local authorities for information.

Empire News posted a bogus article Monday titled “Bin Laden Shooter Rob O’Neill Mistakenly Attacked by Street Thugs Seeking To Collect Debt From Neighbor.”

“Nothing in the story has a resemblance of truth,” Butte-Silver Bow Undersheriff George Skuletich said Wednesday.

Skuletich does exist, for the record.

What is fabricated in the article includes: the police commissioner, five gang members seeking a drug debt and the Butte Daily Times. Also, O’Neill did not take down the intruders and brew a pot of coffee while awaiting backup.

“We’ve been getting all kinds of calls from across the country,” Sheriff Ed Lester said.

The article has been making its rounds on social media sites. This prompted Snopes.com to label it false.

“Empire News is one of many fake news sites responsible for the frequent hoodwinking of Facebook users. Among previous hoaxes were a yarn about welfare recipients getting free cars, a claim that Colorado legalized meth and a widely shared story about pending ‘snowmageddon,’” Snopes notes.

The piece claims that members of the Crips gang broke into the home of the former Navy SEAL and Butte native.

“We don’t have established Bloods or Crips here,” Lester added.

The story goes: “As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. O’Neill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. O’Neill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!”

While some might find the fake news piece amusing, local police are reminded of another hoax of a girl who reportedly shot intruders: An 11-year-old Butte girl was reported to have taken out two crooks. She was reportedly a clay-shooting champion in Butte who killed one man with a shot to the genitals and the other bled out.

That bogus story reappears about every year or so, Lester said.","1"
"Missing Fort Carson item not a nuclear weapon - despite Internet rumors","Despite a wild report on a website dedicated to conspiracy theories, local soldiers haven't lost a low-yield nuclear weapon.

As the lockdown of soldiers in a Fort Carson battalion dragged into its fifth day Monday, the site Whatdoesitmean.com reported that a nuclear artillery shell was missing - an item that hasn't been in the Army inventory for 22 years. That story was translated into several languages, including Russian and spread rapidly on the Internet.

 Photo - The modified M9-Beretta pistol used for the Basic Active Shooter Course fires a powder propelled paint cup to provide the most realistic training possible while maintaining the level of safety required for the scenarios, Jan 26.  The course is taught by a 4-man training team from the 610th Security Forces Squadron, Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas.  They came to Dobbins Air Reserve Base to provide this critical training for the 94th Security Forces Squadron and other Dobbins area security personnel.  The two day course provides classroom and tactical instruction to first responders covering several shooting spree scenarios.   (U.S. Air Force photo/ Brad Fallin) + caption

Sources at the post told The Gazette that the lockdown involving 100 soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armor Regiment is actually for something more mundane - a 9 mm pistol. The Army hasn't officially released details on what spurred the lockdown and search, calling it ""missing government property.""

The lockdown started with about 800 soldiers confined to the battalion's buildings on the post. That was reduced over the weekend to about 100 soldiers - a company of troops.

Retired Command Sgt. Maj. Terrance McWilliams, who served as the post's top enlisted soldier, said lockdowns are a common practice commanders use to turn up lost gear.

""I personally went through it as a 1st sergeant and the longest it took was four days,"" said McWilliams.

The lockdown was triggered Thursday after the pistol turned up missing in an equipment inventory that followed a training exercise. Post officials ordered a wide search for the missing weapon Thursday, including inspecting cars as they exited the post at gates.

Retired Command Sgt. Maj. John Kurak, who also held Fort Carson's top enlisted post, said a five-day lockdown isn't close to a record for Fort Carson.

""In Fort Carson's history there have been lockdowns that have lasted months,"" Kurak said, noting that an infantry battalion on there spent three months on lockdown in the late 1980s after a M-16 rifle was lost.

McWilliams said the first step in the search for the weapon likely was quizzing the soldier who checked it out from the unit's armory for the training exercise. The battalion's soldiers were returning from a training exercise that spanned a wide swath of the 137,000-acre post.

When it was determined that the weapon was lost, soldiers were likely sent to scouring training areas in a move called ""hands across Fort Carson"" that sees soldiers walking shoulder-to-shoulder to find the missing weapon.

When that didn't bear fruit, soldiers were ordered to remain on duty and on post until the weapon was found - a lockdown.

Long lockdowns like the one that deprived 1st Battalion soldiers of what was a planned four-day weekend, do come to an end.

""Eventually its going to get to the point where they determine the item is actually lost,"" McWilliams said. ""Then they will determine what actions to take against the person responsible for the item.""

Losing a weapon can bring stiff consequences in the military, where loss or destruction of government property can be charged as a crime bringing up to a year behind bars.

The Army spends a lot of time keeping track of pistols, rifles and other ""sensitive"" items. Every training day begins and ends with a sensitive items check, and daily inventories are sent up through the chain of command.

""If you can't keep track of your equipment, how can you be expected to do more complex tasks?"" Kurak asked.

In combat, units heading out and returning from stop for a ""boys and toys"" check to make sure all weapons, night vision goggles, laser sights, radios and other items are on hand.

""Accountability of equipment is a basic and essential function of a unit,"" Kurak said.

While the battalion may have lost a pistol, scores of web pages carried the nuclear weapon tale Monday. That story, attributed to unnamed Russian intelligence sources, alleged that a 155 mm artillery-fired nuclear warhead is missing at the post.

The battalion involved, though, doesn't have artillery. And the W-48 artillery warhead alleged to be missing was pulled from Army bases worldwide in 1992.

While the Pikes Peak region is home to a five military bases, it doesn't house nuclear weapons. The closest nuclear arms are atop Air Force intercontinental ballistic missiles at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyo.","1"
"The @FoxNewsPress Account Tweeting Lawsuit Threats Is a Fake","Last night, @FoxNewsPress, the Twitter account claiming to be that of the Fox News public relations team, went live. One big problem: It’s a fake.

The hashtag refers to a meme that blew up after a Fox contributor declared that certain British cities had been swallowed whole by Muslim immigrants. “In Britain, it’s not just no-go zones, there are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don’t go in,” said Steve Emerson, whose statement was so absurd that it was actually debunked by British PM David Cameron himself. (For the record, Birmingham’s Christian population is twice the size of the Muslim population.)

"AP report: Police say gunman in FSU library shooting, Myron May, was alumnus","TALLAHASSEE, Fla. —Police said the suspected gunman in a shooting at Florida State University was an alumnus, according to a report by the Associated Press.

The Tallahassee Police Department held a news conference on Thursday morning to discuss a shooting at FSU that left three students injured. The gunman was shot and killed by officers, police said.

A Florida State University student recalls the terrifying moments when a gunman opened fire on campus on Thursday morning. Jason Derfuss said he later realized the books in his backpack stopped the bullets from striking him. Investigators said three other students were injured and the gunman was shot and killed by police.

The report said the shooter, Myron May, graduated from FSU before attending Texas Tech University's law school.

May was fatally shot early Thursday morning after he shot three people at the Florida State Library, police said.

Two students were taken to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital with gunshot wounds and a third victim was treated on scene for a grazing wound, according to Tallahassee Police spokesman Dave Northway. The victims' names and conditions were not released.

A campus alert urged people to take shelter and stay away from doors and windows after the gunman opened fire inside Strozier Library just after 12 a.m., according to police.

""FSU alert dangerous situation main campus-Tallahassee,"" the alert read. ""Seek shelter immediately, away from doors and windows.""

There were approximately 300 to 400 students inside the library at the time of the shooting. Students shoved tables and book shelves against doors to barricade themselves.

As the incident unfolded, anxious students sent tweets and text messages to loved ones.

""There's a man with a gun in the library,"" Samantha Sillick said in a text to her father. ""I love you.""

A survivor told WESH 2 News he was there during the terrifying moments when bullets began to fly.

""I heard what was unmistakably a gunshot behind me, and initially I kind of tried to rationalize it as a firecracker, but I knew exactly what it was,"" said Jason Derfuss, an FSU student. ""He gunned down another student right in front of me about 50 feet away.""



Derfuss said the gunman also fired several gunshots at him, but the books in his backpack stopped the bullets from striking his body.

Police said the officers rushed the area and shot the gunman when he refused to drop his weapon and fired at officers.

""Instead of complying with their commands, the gunman, in turn, fired a shot at the officers and they returned fire, killing the suspect,"" said Northway.

Police said the gunman acted alone, and there is no further threat to the university. Students have been allowed back into the library to retrieve their belongings.

""If there's any positive news we can take from this occurrence is that the victim count was not greater,"" said the city's Mayor-elect Andrew Gillum.

On Thursday, Gov. Rick Scott said he is praying for the victims, their families and the entire FSU community.

""I know every Seminole has a heart of a dreamer and every dreamer is resilient,"" said Scott.

FSU's new president, John Thrasher, released a statement that said in part:

""The Florida State University community is extremely saddened by the shootings that took place early this morning at Strozier Library, in the very heart of campus, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of all those who have been affected.""


Thrasher also said the university will be increasing security measures and providing strong law enforcement presence on and around campus on Thursday, although the campus will be closed for the day.

FSU officials also said there will be counselors available for any students or employees in need.

The five officers involved in the shooting were placed on routine paid administrative leave.

Abigail Taunton told the AP that May had recently been staying at a guest house she owns in a rural area in the Florida Panhandle. She said police interviewed her husband, David, after the shooting.

FSU is one of the top research universities in the nation. It has about 40,000 students spread out in various campuses in the city, and is also considered one of the nation's top-ranked football teams.

The campus will reopen for classes and normal operations on Friday.","1"
"Saudi airline rep denies plan to separate men and women on flights","Saudia Airlines, the state-run airline of Saudi Arabia, does not have plans to separate passengers based on gender, according to an airline source quoted in stories claiming the opposite.

Several Gulf area and UK media outlets reported that the airline planned to seat unrelated men and women after receiving complaints.

“There are solutions to this problem,"" Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, an assistant marketing manager for Saudia, was quoted as saying to Saudi Arabia daily Ajel. ""We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.""

Although Ajel reported that those solutions would include separating men and women unless they are closely related, the source of the quote said the story was fabricated, and that his quote was taken out of context.

@RunwayGirl @JetwayMJ my name was mentioned there, it is a total false and fabrication.

@RunwayGirl a follower asked me how would the airline solve the issue of separate family seating that is a root of most delays, I answered:

@RunwayGirl we are trying a solution and awaiting the outcome(.)It is on how to rearrange splitting family members aboard but got twisted:)

— عبدالرحمن الفهـد (@ahfahad) January 2, 2015

The rumor was perhaps more believable after an incident last week, when ultra-Orthodox Jewish men delayed an Israel-bound Delta flight because they refused to sit next to female passengers.

And Saudi Arabia has persistent gender disparities: The World Economic Forum ranked Saudi Arabia 127th out of 136 countries for women's rights in its Global Gender Gap Report in 2013.

There are restrictions on women — for example, they are not permitted to drive in the country — however there have also been signs of recent change. Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah announced in 2011 that women would be able to vote in 2015 elections.

Saudia is a member of the SkyTeam alliance.

"No gender segregation on Saudia","Saudi Arabian Airlines on Sunday dismissed claims made by some local media outlets that the national flag carrier is planning to segregate men and women on its flights.
Denying that such arrangements are being considered, Abdullah Al-Ajhar, the airline’s spokesman, termed the reports as “false” and “misleading.”
Speaking to Arab News, Al-Ajhar asserted that there are no plans to separate passengers based on their gender.
A few days ago, international media, quoting a local daily, reported that Saudia is planning to segregate according to gender, following complaints of uncomfortable journeys by male relatives of female passengers.
According to the report, some passengers complained that females sitting next to non-related male passengers felt uncomfortable.
In the report, the international news organization quoted Abdul Rahman Al-Fahd, airline’s vice president for marketing, as saying that measures would be taken to solve this problem.
However, the official concerned denied having made any statement on segregation. He asserted that his quote was taken out of context.
Al-Fahd tried to clear the air on the matter by tweeting what he claimed was his real response: “I answered: We are trying to find a solution and awaiting the outcome.”
In a significant but unrelated move, Saudia has extended the validity of domestic flight tickets from 6 months to 1 year from Jan. 1.

"YPG Confirms: Gill Rosenberg Not Captured in Kobani","Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured. Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story ""mere propaganda"". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible. Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting. Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north. Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet.

"Canadian-Israeli Woman Says She Hasn’t Been Captured By ISIS","Gillian Rosenberg, the Canadian-Israeli woman fighting ISIS with Kurdish forces in Syria, has updated her Facebook page to say that, contrary to reports, she has not been captured by militant forces.

“Guys, I’m totally safe and secure,” she wrote Monday. “I don’t have Internet access or any communication devices with me for my safety and security. I can’t reply regularly and only happened to have a chance to log in and see these buklshit [sik] news stories. Ignore the reports that I’ve been captured.”

News of Rosenberg’s apparent capture first emerged online on ISIS-affiliated websites early Sunday morning. The websites did not post any proof or state whether she was in Iraq or Syria, The Jerusalem Post reported, only saying that she had been taken hostage following three suicide attacks on Kurdish forces.

The Canadian and Israeli governments said Sunday that they were looking into reports that a Canadian-Israeli woman had been captured by ISIS in Syria. They have not yet confirmed the news posted on Rosenberg’s page.

Rosenberg is believed to be the first foreign female fighter to join Syrian Kurds in their fight against ISIS.

In an interview with Israel Radio earlier this month, Rosenberg claimed to be in Iraq and said she was training with Kurdish guerrillas and planned to battle militants in Syria. When asked about her decision to fight, she said, “[The Kurds] are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really.”

Rosenberg left Canada and moved to Israel in 2006 and served for two years in the Israeli Defense Forces.

In 2009, she was arrested and extradited to the United States for her involvement “in a phony ‘lottery prize’ scheme that targeted victims, mostly elderly.” She served three years in jail for fraud.

Rosenberg said she communicated with Kurdish fighters online before deciding to join them. According to her Facebook page, she arrived in Iraq on Nov. 2.

Rosenberg recently wrote about her eagerness to join the Kurdish forces on her Facebook page.

She also posted pictures of herself, seemingly in Iraq and Syria.

On Nov. 20, Rosenberg said that she would not have access to the internet for two weeks and that someone else would be managing her account.

Photos of Rosenberg brandishing a weapon and stepping on an ISIS flag appeared on LiveLeak on Nov. 22.

"Canadian woman 'captured by ISIS in Syria' says she is actually fine and still fighting the jihadists, despite kidnap reports","The Canadian woman who was reportedly kidnapped by ISIS has said she is fine, and that rumors of her capture spread on jihadist websites are untrue.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, joined the ranks of the Kurdish peshmerga fighting force this year, which has elite all-female units.

ISIS sources reported Sunday that Rosenberg was captured in the contested town of Kobane, on the Turkish border, and were gleefully debating whether to execute her or try to negotiate a prisoner swap.

But now Rosenberg, who leaves sporadic updates about her campaign against extremism on Facebook, has posted to clarify that she is in fact alive and well.

Sources in the Kurdish militia also confirmed that she is unharmed and was not captured.

Idris Nassan, an official in Kobane, said he had been told by peshmerga members she is fine, and dismissed the reports of propaganda..

Even when the initial reports came out, some sources were sceptical and said Rosenberg was nowhere near Kobane in the first place.

Rosenberg, a joint citizen of Israel who served in the Israeli Defense Force, went to fight against the so-called Islamic State earlier this month, while they were locked in combat over Kobane, a town on the Turkey-Syria border.

She had earlier posted on social media explaining her decision to go and fight, declaring she sympathized with the Kurds, whose territory has come under heavy assault.

Her position in the Israeli military is thought to have been a non-combat role.

After the reports over the weekend of her capture, Canadian and Israeli government sources said they were investigating the possibility.

IS jihadists began advancing on Kobane on September 16, hoping to quickly seize the small town and secure its grip on a large stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border, following advances it made in Iraq.

At one point, it looked set to overrun the town, but Kurdish Syrian fighters, backed by coalition air strikes and an influx of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga forces, have held back the group.

Several Islamist blogs and websites reported last week that Rosenberg
had been captured by ISIS.

A blog considered to be one of the Islamic State's media arms reported that several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been captured, among them Rosenberg. According to the report, prior to their capture Islamic State fighters made three suicide bombing attacks against Kurdish outposts, killing some and capturing many others.

Kurdish sources denied the reports, saying that Rosenberg wasn't in the area when it was attacked.

In her previous Facebook post on November 20, Rosenberg wrote that she would be without internet access for at least two weeks.

""My Facebook account and friend requests are being managed by someone else until I have access again in apx 2 weeks time on or around week of 12/8,"" she wrote at the time. ""Please do not message as this is not me. Thank you.""

Rosenberg, 31, a resident of Tel Aviv, joined the Kurdish troops against Islamic State in northern Syria earlier this month. According to reports, Rosenberg said she had contacted Kurdish fighters over the
Internet before traveling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

According to Walla, Rosenberg immigrated to Israel from Canada in 2006, leaving behind a career as a civilian pilot, and served for two years in the Israel Defense Forces. In 2009, she was extradited to the United States and jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said.

Israel Radio aired an interview with Rosenberg earlier in November in which she said she had travelled to Iraq, was training with Kurdish guerrillas and would fight in neighboring Syria.

A former IDF soldier who joined up with Kurdish militias to fight against the Islamic State, Rosenberg had been the subject of a Canadian government inquiry after rumors circulated on jihadist forums over the weekend that she had been taken prisoner in the Syrian town of Kobani.

The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the 31-year-old from White Rock, a suburb of Vancouver, served two years in the Israeli army. While in Israel in 2009 she was arrested as part of an international fraud ring and brought to the United States to serve time in jail.

International Business Times was unable to verify that Rosenberg herself was responsible for the post.

Rosenberg, 31, who migrated to Israel from Canada in 2006, is believed to have served for two years in the Israeli military, according to a report by Haaretz. She had earlier claimed, through photos published on the same account, that she had joined Kurdish forces battling ISIS in Iraqi Kurdistan in the country’s north.

Jihadists believed to be loyal to ISIS had claimed on Sunday that Rosenberg, along with a number of female fighters, had been abducted near Kobani and that the Israeli military was deliberately trying to curb the news of her capture. However, a number of media outlets subsequently raised doubts over the claims, citing Kurdish sources, who said that Rosenberg was nowhere near Kobani.

""This is false propaganda by IS,” Kurdish sources told The Times of Israel. ""We can say with a high level of certainty that no Israeli volunteer, or any international volunteer for that matter, arrived to fight in the city of Kobani in Syria.""

The Israeli government, which on Sunday said it was investigating reports of her capture, had also stressed that the information was of “dubious credibility,” according to a report by The Times of Israel. “I cannot confirm that [report of Rosenberg’s capture] and I hope that it isn’t true,” Israel’s Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon had reportedly said.","1"

The report about Rosenberg's capture has not been confirmed by ISIS.

An American who is fighting in the ranks of the Kurds told Voice of Israel that Rosenberg was not in the Kobane region. “She was never in Kobane, that's not reasonable that she was captured,” he said. The head of the station's foreign news desk, Eran Sikorel, said that he, too, had information that Rosenberg had been stationed in eastern Syria and not in the Kobane region, which is in central Syria. 

Yisrael Hayom quotes a senior Kurdish source who confirmed that Rosenberg joined the Kurdish resistance in Syria and said she was the first western woman to join its fighters. The source added that ten other western citizens who are not of Kurdish origin have also joined the Kurdish fighters in recent days.

Earlier on Sunday, the monitoring group SITE said Islamic State (ISIS) jihadists claimed a ""female Zionist soldier"" had been captured in the embattled Syrian border town.

Some jihadists said the woman might be Rosenberg, who had served in the Israel Defense Forces and had volunteered to fight with the Kurds, the monitoring group said.

""The Government of Canada is aware of reports that a Canadian citizen was kidnapped in Syria,"" a foreign ministry statement said, according to AFP.

"6 Islamist militants killed in US attack in Somalia","MOGADISHU, Somalia — Al-Shabaab’s top leader was traveling in one of two vehicles hit Monday night in a US military strike, a member of the Somali Islamic extremist group said Tuesday.

The spokesman would not say whether al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was among the six militants killed.

The two vehicles were heading toward the coastal town of Barawe, al-Shabaab’s main base, when they were hit, Abu Mohammed told the Associated Press. A witness in Somalia described ground-shaking explosions in the strike.

Al-Shabaab attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people, a year ago this month, and the US targeted planners of the bloody assault. US commanders were waiting to determine the attack’s outcome.

“US military forces conducted an operation in Somalia today against the al-Shabaab network. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,” said Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby.

After the US strike in a forest south of Mogadishu, masked Islamic militants in the area arrested dozens of residents they suspected of spying for the US and searched nearby homes, a resident said.

“Mass arrests just started, everyone is being detained,” said Mohamed Ali, who lives in the Sablale district. “They even searched nearby jungles and stopped the nomads transporting milk and grass to the towns for questioning.”

A senior Somali intelligence official said a US drone targeted Godane as he left a meeting of the group’s top leaders. Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is the group’s spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al Qaeda. In 2012, the US offered a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his arrest.

The Somali official, speaking on condition of anonymity since he was not authorized to speak to the media, said intelligence indicated Godane “might have been killed along with other militants.” The official said the attack took place 105 miles (170 kilometers) south of Mogadishu, where al-Shabaab trains its fighters.

As government and African Union forces were heading to a town in the district, they heard what sounded like an “earthquake” as the al-Shabaab bases were hit, the governor of Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region, Abdiqadir Mohamed Nor, told the Associated Press.

“There was an airstrike near Sablale. We saw something,” Nor said.

The US has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia in recent years.

A US missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabaab, and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a US strike that killed al-Shabaab’s top explosives expert.

The latest US action comes after Somalia’s government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital that was attacked Sunday. Seven heavily armed suspected al-Shabaab members had attempted to free other extremists held there.

Somali officials said all seven attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Mogadishu’s Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia’s intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison and the gunmen then fought their way into the prison.

Al-Shabaab had attacked the mall in Nairobi last year in retaliation against Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. Godane said at the time that the attack was carried out in retaliation for the West’s support for Kenya’s Somalia intervention and the “interest of their oil companies.”

Al-Shabaab is now mostly active in Somalia’s rural regions after being ousted from the capital by African Union forces in 2011.

Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabaab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting.","1"
"Somali terrorist leader dead after US airstrike","WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Friday confirmed the death of the leader of the al-Shabab terror group, Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was the target of a U.S. airstrike Monday in Somalia.

The Pentagon’s press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, confirmed the death in a brief written statement. President Barack Obama, speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Newport, Wales, said the successful U.S. strike was an example of his administration’s determination to hit back at terrorists.

Obama said the U.S. would use the same approach in degrading the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.

“We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kind of organizations” that threaten U.S. personnel and the homeland, Obama said. “That deliberation allows us to do it right, but have no doubt: We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people.”

The White House declared a counterterrorism success.

“Godane’s removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al-Qaida affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,” a White House statement said.

“Even as this is an important step forward in the fight against al-Shabab, the United States will continue to use the tools at our disposal – financial, diplomatic, intelligence and military – to address the threat that al-Shabab and other terrorist groups pose to the United States and the American people.” It added.

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

The State Department declared al-Shabab a terrorist organization in February 2008.

Kirby said on Tuesday, before the Pentagon was certain that Godane had died, that the U.S. strike was conducted south of Mogadishu and that it had destroyed the vehicle that was targeted. He noted that in September 2013, Godone had publicly claimed al-Shabab was responsible for the deadly Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya.

“Under the leadership of Godane, al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for many bombings, including suicide attacks in Mogadishu and in central and northern Somalia, typically targeting officials and perceived allies of the federal government of Somalia, as well as the former transitional federal government of Somali,” Kirby said Tuesday.","1"
"US airstrike targets Al Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane in Somalia","The US is assessing whether an airstrike on an encampment in Somalia killed the leader of the Al Shabaab terrorist group.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said drones and manned aircraft bombed a gathering of Al Shabaab commanders in a camp in south-central Somalia on Monday.

""US special operations forces using manned and unmanned aircraft destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions,"" he said.

Mr Kirby confirmed that the attack was aimed at leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, also referred to as Abu-Zubayr, and that the bombs definitely hit the meeting of Shabaab chiefs.

But he said it was unclear if Godane had been killed in the raid.

""We are still assessing the results of the operation, and we'll provide additional information when and if appropriate,"" he said.

The assault did not involve US ground troops, Mr Kirby added.

He declined to provide details of the special operations forces' unit that took part in the air raid or the nature of the intelligence that led to the strike.

The militant group is fighting to overthrow the Somali government, regularly launching attacks against state targets and in neighbouring countries that contribute to the African Union force.

Since taking charge in 2008, Godane has restyled Al Shabaab as a global player in the al Qaeda franchise - a transformation that was highlighted when it killed at least 67 people in an attack on a Kenyan shopping mall last September.

The US State Department has listed Godane as one of the world's eight top terror fugitives and, if confirmed, his death would mark a serious setback for Al Shabaab forces.

The bombing raid reflected a commitment by Washington and its allies ""to detect, deter, disrupt and defeat violent extremists who threaten progress in the region, as well as ... threaten to conduct terrorist attacks against innocent people around the world,"" Mr Kirby said.

"Al-Shabaab Terror Group Leader Killed in U.S. Airstrike","The Pentagon confirmed today that the U.S. killed Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of the al-Shabaab insurgent group in Somalia, in an airstrike this week.

U.S. special operations forces targeted Godane in southern Somalia in a Sept. 1 attack using manned aircraft and drones to destroy an encampment and a vehicle. It took several days to confirm initial reports that he died in the attack.

“The United States works in coordination with its friends, allies and partners to counter the regional and global threats posed by violent extremist organizations,” Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon’s spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement confirming the mission’s success.

Al-Shabaab, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, was declared a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department in 2008. Godane claimed responsibility for the attack last year on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya’s capital of Nairobi, in which at least 67 people died. The U.S. has offered a $7 million reward for information on his whereabouts.

“Godane’s removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al-Qaeda affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.
Godane was among a number of “high-ranking” al-Shabaab officials who were meeting at Dhaytubako, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) southwest of the capital, Mogadishu, when the attack occurred, Lower Shabelle Governor Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur said in a phone interview Sept. 2.

Suicide Bombings

In recent months, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Djibouti that killed a Turkish national and wounded several Western soldiers as well a car bomb at the Mogadishu airport that targeted and killed members of a United Nations convoy, according to the statement.

Al-Shabaab was responsible for twin suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, on July 11, 2010, that killed more than 70 people, including one American. The group has also been responsible for the assassination of Somali peace activists, international aid workers, numerous civil society figures, and journalists.

Godane is believed to have ordered the Westgate Mall massacre in Kenya in September 2013 that killed 67 people

U.S. officials have not yet confirmed Godane is among the dead

U.S. drone strikes are believed to have killed the leader of the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab, who ordered the massacre at a Kenyan shopping mall last year that killed 67 people.

U.S. Intelligence officials believe Ahmed Abdi Godane was traveling in a two-car convoy Monday night near al-Shabab's main base in Barawe when American drone aircraft hit the vehicles with missiles.

Six people were killed in the attack and Somali authorities say they think Godane is among the dead - though the Pentagon said it is still awaiting confirmation.

Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is al-Shabab's spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al-Qaida and became the most high-profile terrorist group in Africa.

Under Godane's orders, the group attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people a year ago this month.

The group was also responsible for a suicide bombing at a World Cup watching party in Kampala, Uganda, in 2010 that left 74 dead and 70 injured.

The U.S. has targeted planners of the bloody Westgate assault, in which four Britons and two Canadians were killed. A month after the attack, Navy SEALs landed at al-Shabab's headquarters in Barawe and attempted to capture another mastermind behind the attack.

In 2012, the U.S. government put a $7million price on Godane's head - though he has escaped justice until now.

A witness to Monday's airstrike in Somalia described ground-shaking explosions caused by the missile. Somali government and African Union forces heading to a town in the district heard what sounded like an 'earthquake' as the al-Shabab bases were hit, the governor of Somalia's Lower Shabelle region, Abdiqadir Mohamed Nor, told The Associated Press.

'There was an airstrike near Sablale. We saw something,' Nor said.

U.S. commanders said they are waiting to determine the outcome of Monday's attack.

'U.S. military forces conducted an operation in Somalia today against the al-Shabab network. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,' said Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby.

After the U.S. strike in a forest near Sablale district south of Mogadishu, masked Islamic militants in the area arrested dozens of residents they suspected of spying for the U.S. and searched nearby homes, a resident said.

Godane is believed to have ordered the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya, last year that claimed 67 lives in Kenya. He also forged the groups alliance with al-Qaeda

'Mass arrests just started, everyone is being detained,' said Mohamed Ali, who lives in Sablale district. 'They even searched nearby jungles and stopped the nomads transporting milk and grass to the towns for questioning.'

The U.S. has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia in recent years.

A U.S. missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabab and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a U.S. strike that killed al-Shabab's top explosives expert.

The latest U.S. action comes after Somalia's government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital that was attacked on Sunday. Seven heavily armed suspected al-Shabab members had attempted to free other extremists held there.

Somali officials said all seven attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Mogadishu's Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia's intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison and the gunmen then fought their way into the prison.

Al-Shabab attacked the mall in Nairobi last year to punish Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. Godane said at the time that the mall attack was carried out in retaliation for the West's support for Kenya's Somalia intervention and the 'interest of their oil companies.'

Al Shabab is now mostly active in Somalia's rural regions after being ousted from the capital by African Union forces in 2011.

Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, located about 110 kilometers (70 miles) south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting.","1"
"US confirms death of Somalia terror group leader","WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. airstrikes earlier this week killed the leader of the al-Shabab terrorist group in Somalia, the Pentagon said Friday. President Barack Obama said the death of Ahmed Abdi Godane demonstrated U.S. counterterrorism resolve and was an example of his deliberate approach to dismantling al-Qaida affiliated groups.

The Pentagon's press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, announced the death in a brief written statement. It took the Pentagon four days to conclusively determine that Godane had not survived Monday's airstrikes.

Al-Shabab has not publicly confirmed Godane's death.

Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud urged al-Shabab militants to renounce violence, saying they have an opportunity to embrace peace following Godane's death.

""While an extreme hardcore may fight over the leadership of al-Shabab, this is a chance for the majority of members of al-Shabab to change course and reject Godane's decision to make them the pawns of an international terror campaign,"" he said in a statement.

The Somali president said the U.S. operation was carried out ""with the full knowledge and agreement of"" his government and that Somalis ""greatly value the support of our international allies"" in the fight against al-Shabab.

Obama, speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Newport, Wales, told reporters the success against al-Shabab should leave no doubt about his determination to degrade and eventually destroy the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. military announced later Friday that a mix of fighter jets, drones, attack planes and bombers launched four airstrikes Thursday and Friday in northern Iraq, destroying a host of Islamic State targets including an observation post, an armed vehicle and three mortar positions.

Obama faces mounting pressure to take more aggressive military action against the Islamic State, which evolved from an al-Qaida affiliate that sprouted in Iraq in 2004.

""We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kinds of organizations"" that threaten U.S. personnel and the homeland, Obama said. ""That deliberation allows us to do it right, but have no doubt: We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people.""

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

The State Department declared al-Shabab a terrorist organization in February 2008. The implications of the group's loss of Godane are unclear.

""The individual who takes his place will live in fear,"" said Army Col. Steven Warren, a Pentagon spokesman.

Because Godane had weakened and effectively dismantled the al-Shabab council of leaders known as the shura, a meeting of regional commanders will have to take place to pick his successor, said Matt Bryden, the head of Sahan Research in Nairobi, Kenya. Bryden predicted the meeting will be difficult and dangerous to organize.

Terrorism analyst J.M. Berger predicted a significant splintering between al-Shabab's domestically focused insurgents and internationally aspiring terrorists.

Abdi Aynte, a Somali analyst who runs a Mogadishu-based think tank called the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies, predicted that Godane's death ""will almost certainly be the beginning of the end of the organization.""

Under Godane's leadership, he said, al-Shabab had gradually become a guerrilla movement that avoided conventional warfare, tactics that suited it amid mounting military pressure from African Union troops and government forces.

Godane, who was born in 1977 and raised in the town of Hargeisa in the autonomous region of Somaliland, was said to be a quiet boy who was interested in the Quran and Islamic studies in his early years. His relatives there described him as ""a private man"" who was devoted to Islamic teachings at mosques, said Mohamed Hassan, a former senior Somali intelligence official in Somaliland who once was tasked with tracking down Godane over charges the future terror leader stole money when he worked for a local telecommunications company. In Somaliland, he also had been accused of involvement in the murder of foreigners.

Godane is believed to have settled in Mogadishu in 2004, working at local charities before he joined the Islamic Courts Union, al-Shabab's precursor group that once controlled Mogadishu and many parts of Somalia before it was ousted by Ethiopian forces.

"Terror Leader Ahmed Abdi Godane Killed in U.S. Strike","Ahmed Abdi Godane — the leader of al Shabab, the Islamic militant organization behind the siege on a mall in Kenya last year — was killed in a U.S. military strike earlier this week, an al Shabab source told NBC News on Friday.

The Pentagon confirmed the death later in the day.

“Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to al Shabab,” said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman. “The United States works in coordination with its friends, allies and partners to counter the regional and global threats posed by violent extremist organizations.”

A U.S. security official also told NBC News earlier in the week that Shabab had been killed by the strike on Monday. U.S. officials had said publicly after the strike that Godane was targeted, but that they were not sure whether he was dead.

The al Shabab source told NBC News that Godane was among 11 militants killed. Also killed were an operations leader, a financial official and a military strategist for the organization, the source said.

“It’s a big win,” the U.S. security official said. “He was operationally savvy and ideologically driven, with aspirations off the charts.” The official said that nine Hellfire missiles and one 500-pound guided bomb had been used in the strike.

The Reuters news agency reported Friday that the Somali prime minister had confirmed the death on Facebook, but Reuters later withdrew that report. A Somali government spokesman told Reuters that the government had not yet commented on whether Godane was dead.

The siege last September at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi left 67 people dead and about 200 injured.

The United States in 2012 offered a $7 million reward for his arrest. Godane took leadership of al Shabab after his predecessor was killed in an American airstrike in 2008.","1"
"U.S. airstrike kills Islamic Al Shabab terrorist leader in Somalia","Ahmed Abdi Godane was the 'principal target' of the Monday attack.

A U.S. airstrike killed the leader of a Somali terrorist group Monday, the Pentagon confirmed Friday.

Al Shabab head Ahmed Abdi Godane — who was considered one of the world's most wanted men — was the 'the principal target' of the attack, officials said Tuesday when they announced the strike.

The Pentagon knew immediately that six people were killed in the Monday strike, but Godane was not identified as a victim until Friday.

The other five victims have not been identified.

Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, was the reviled leader of the Al Qaeda-affiliated group. The State Department desperately wanted to find him and had put a $7 million bounty on his head.

His death deals a major blow to the Somali terror network, the Pentagon said.

Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Defense Department’s chief spokesman, said the drone and aircraft attack directly targeted the terrorists.

Six people, including Godane, were killed. The other five victims have not been named.

In the strike, missiles destroyed a suspected terrorist compound near the port city of Barawe, a stronghold of the group. The missiles hit Godane as he left a meeting of the group's top leaders.

President Barack Obama said airstrike was highly calculated and well planned.

“That deliberation allows us to do it right,” he said at a Friday press conference.

The airstrike against Al Shabab is part of the U.S.’s larger anti-terrorism campaign. Troops have previously launched strikes against ISIS terrorists in Iraq.

“The goal has to be dismantle them,” Obama said of ISIS, Al Shabab and other terrorist organizations.

"Pentagon: death of al Shabaab leader in U.S. strike would be major blow","(Reuters) - The Pentagon is assessing whether an airstrike on an encampment in Somalia killed al Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, but if confirmed the militant's death would represent a ""very significant"" blow to the group, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

Rear Admiral John Kirby told a Pentagon briefing that the U.S. special operations strike conducted on Monday involved manned and unmanned aircraft. Kirby said Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions were dropped on the camp in south-central Somalia, but he said it was too soon to say what the results of the strike had been.

Since taking charge in 2008, Godane has restyled the group as a global player in the al Qaeda franchise - a transformation that was highlighted when it killed at least 67 people in an attack on a Kenyan shopping mall last September.

"Al-Shabaab co-founder confirmed killed by US air strike in Somalia","The Pentagon has confirmed that Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab, was killed in a US air strike earlier this week.

The United States previously said that the strike inside Somalia had targeted Godane, but did not know whether he had been killed.

“We have confirmed that Ahmed Godane, the co-founder of al-Shabaab, has been killed,” said rear admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, describing it as a “major symbolic and operational loss” for the militant group, which aligned itself with al-Qaida.

Al-Shabaab is fighting to topple Somalia’s western-backed government and regularly launches bombings and gun attacks against state targets and civilians. Godane’s death could now lead to an internal power struggle.

On Wednesday US officials had said they were still investigating to see whether the strike on an al-Shabaab encampment had killed Godane, 37, who reportedly trained with the Taliban in Afghanistan.

At least three strikes hit a convoy of al-Shabaab vehicles in southern Somalia on Monday night, according to witnesses and a spokesman for the group who spoke later with the Associated Press. The al-Shabaab representative said that six al-Shabaab fighters had been killed in the strikes.

The air raid came days after African Union (AU) troops and Somali government forces launched “Operation Indian Ocean”, a major offensive aimed at seizing key ports from al-Shabaab and cutting off one of their key sources of revenue: multi-million dollar exports of charcoal. AU forces were targeting Shabaab on several fronts, with Ugandan troops leading the offensives against the main port of Barawe, south of the capital, Mogadishu.

The commander of the AU in Somalia has said the death of Godane would be a “proud and happy moment for all Africa”.

Godane, who has a passion for poetry, seized world attention a year ago with the Westgate mall attack in Nairobi, which left at least 67 dead. He warned Kenya that it would suffer further atrocities unless it withdrew its troops from the AU force in Somalia.

“You cannot withstand a war of attrition inside your own country,” he said in an audio message posted on a website linked to al-Shabaab. “So withdraw all your forces, or be prepared for an abundance of blood that will be spilt in your country.”

Washington has carried out a series of drone missile strikes in the past, including attacks reportedly targeting Godane, but rarely confirms this officially.

Godane took over the leadership of al-Shabaab in 2008 after then chief Adan Hashi Ayro was killed by a US missile strike.

Also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, Godane was al-Shabaab’s spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al-Qaida. In 2012 the US offered a reward of up to $7m (£4.2m) for information leading to his arrest.","1"

"Pentagon: Airstrike killed terror leader in Somalia","WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Friday confirmed that the leader of al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-linked organization in Africa, was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Somalia this week.

The leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, was targeted Monday in an airstrike that hit a vehicle and compound in a militant stronghold south of the capital, Mogadishu.

Al-Shabab has been linked to a number of attacks in Africa, including the bloody siege at the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2013 that killed 67 people.

U.S. military officials had acknowledged that they were trying to kill Godane in Monday’s air assault on a Shabab compound in southern Somalia.

Speaking to reporters at the NATO summit in Wales, President Obama cited Godane’s death as the result of the U.S. government’s “very systematic and methodical approach” in combating al-Shabab, al-Qaeda, Islamic State and other radical networks.

“That deliberation allows us to do it right,” he added. “But, have no doubt, we will continue and I will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people.”

But they had been cautious about asserting the mission was successful, mindful of reports of other al-Qaeda leaders who had been killed in drone attacks, only to resurface later.

Al-Shabab, which means “the youth” in Arabic, is a jihadist movement that has formally affiliated itself with al-Qaeda. Born in Somalia, a chronically unstable country on the Horn of Africa, it has transformed itself from a domestic insurgency into a regional terrorist group that has carried out attacks in Kenya and Uganda. The network also has cooperated with al-Qaeda’s franchise in Yemen.

“Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to al-Shabab,” Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement.

Monday’s drone strike was the most aggressive U.S. military operation in Somalia in nearly a year, and it came as the Obama administration was already grappling with security crises in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine.

Godane took public responsibility for the Sept. 21, 2013 attack on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in which Shabab gunmen killed dozens of people and held Kenyan security forces at bay for days.

Counterterrorism officials and analysts have described Godane as a particularly ruthless jihadi leader who eliminated several rivals within al-Shabab, either by killing them or forcing them to go underground.

Although Godane had sworn allegiance to al-Qaeda and his group has been a menace in East Africa, U.S. counterterrorism officials have been divided over how much of a direct threat al-Shabab poses to the United States.

The State Department officially declared al-Shabab a terrorist organization in 2008. In a statement Friday, the White House said that Godane had “continued to oversee plots targeting Westerners, including U.S. persons, in East Africa,” but did not give further evidence of specific attempts to kill Americans.","1"
"Google seals massive Sunnyvale, Redwood City deals","Google leased all 1.9 million square feet of Moffett Place, a Sunnyvale office complex under development by Jay Paul Co.

Google Inc. has cemented a pair of massive real estate deals in Sunnyvale and Redwood City that boost the company's Silicon Valley footprint by 2.8 million square feet – about the size of the Empire State Building and enough room for more than 10,000 workers.

Even by Google standards, the latest transactions are blockbusters: In one deal, Google has agreed to lease all of Jay Paul Co.'s Moffett Place, a 1.9 million square foot office campus currently under construction in Sunnyvale. It's a contender for the largest office lease ever signed in Silicon Valley and perhaps the state of California.

In a separate but no less notable deal, Mountain View-based Google completed the purchase of six buildings from Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital totaling about 934,000 square feet at Redwood City's Pacific Shores office park. It's Google's first entry into that city and a potential game changer for that commercial real estate market.

""Google is obviously a very strong company and they are in hyper growth mode,"" said Amber Schiada, director of research for real estate services firm JLL.

The deals — both of which I previously reported were in the works — were confirmed by sources close to the transactions. Google declined to comment for this story. Blackstone didn't return inquiries. Jay Paul's longtime broker Phil Mahoney of Newmark Cornish & Carey, would only say that Moffett Place is off the market.

Google's expansion on the Peninsula has been the biggest real estate story since the 2008 Great Recession as the world's biggest Web-search advertising company has bought and leased building after building, radiating out from its Mountain View headquarters. Its real estate growth dwarfs even that of Cisco Systems Inc.'s expansion during the 1990s.

Terms of the latest deals were not disclosed, but sources estimated the Redwood City sale at around $625 per square foot, or $583.75 million. That would make it perhaps Google's single largest real estate acquisition by footprint and dollar amount ever in Silicon Valley.

""I welcome them to our city and I look forward to working with them,"" said Redwood City Mayor Jeffrey Gee in an interview this afternoon. ""For a long time I would go around and say, 'Redwood City is one of the best kept secrets in the Bay Area. With Google and everything going on, we're not a secret anymore.'""

Aside from sheer size, the deals are notable for several reasons. First, they showcase Google's incredibly ambitious growth plans as the company enters new business sectors such as wearable computing, self-driving cars and robotics — all of which could be huge space users on their own.

Google has not even moved into much of the space it has leased or bought over the last several years. Yet the company continues to bank more elbow room for future expansion, suggesting it is thinking far down the line in terms of its space needs. Google counted 55,030 employees globally as of Sept. 30, according to its most recent quarterly report, up 18 percent — or 8,600 Googlers — from a year ago.

The transactions also alter the marketplace dynamics in two cities by taking available space off the table. Schiada noted that Moffett Place was the largest speculatively built project under construction in Silicon Valley. In Redwood City's Pacific Shores, which is more than 90 percent leased, I'm told Google will honor all current tenants' leases for now, but will evaluate moving into spaces as they become available in the years ahead.

""A big question is what does this leave for tenants,"" Schiada said, speaking specifically about the Moffett Place deal. ""It also increases rates, because the supply becomes more limited.""

Still, that could actually be a good thing for tenants down the line by pushing developers to build more product, she added.

""This deal essentially eliminates a significant portion of new development, which could prompt more developers to move forward,"" she said.

Jim Beeger, a veteran broker with Colliers International, said in the short term, the Sunnyvale deal could also push tenants back into the market.

The transaction could ""cause tenants of all sizes to realize they should have more of a sense of urgency in their search for a new site,"" he said. ""Moffett Place will be difficult to replicate, and those who lingered no longer have this option.""

Sethena Leiker, senior analyst for Cushman & Wakefield's Silicon Valley office, agreed.

""There's not a lot of spec development coming,"" she said. ""If you want to take any new space, you're going to have to take something that's proposed.""

One result, Beeger said, could be a ""trickle-down effect"" of growing tenants moving to other areas of Santa Clara County that have available sites.

Score for Sunnyvale

Google's lease at Moffett Place is a huge win for San Francisco-based Jay Paul Co., if one that's not entirely unexpected. Jay Paul already leased 949,000 square feet to Google in Sunnyvale at a nearby campus called Technology Corners, making Google a natural prospect for the new development.

And while Google has not yet started moving into Technology Corners, the company has also been growing elsewhere in Sunnyvale this year, snapping up the old Juniper Networks headquarters (424,000 square feet) and former head office of Palm Computing Inc. (285,000 square feet). And it's rumored that a fund, CBRE Global Investors, that's buying up land all around Sunnyvale's Moffett Park business district is actually acting on behalf of Google.

Yet landing Google wasn't guaranteed when Jay Paul started building Moffett Place earlier this year on spec. Other major tech tenants were also making offers on the property, according to sources. The rent Google is paying isn't known, but Jay Paul was asking $3.75 per square foot on a triple-net basis, or not including utilities, taxes and fees.

Redwood City action

In Redwood City, Google picks a up a major chunk one of Silicon Valley's marquee office campuses. The 10-building, 1.7-million-square-foot project was built by Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s and gained notice for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools, a rock-climbing wall, day spa and baseball diamonds.

Starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $833 million, and immediately sold two buildings to Shorenstein, the San Francisco-based landlord. Blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago. Informatica also acquired two buildings out of the 10 in 2012 for $525 per square foot. Google's acquisition this week is only for the six Blackstone/Starwood buildings.

As I reported earlier this month, a new owner could build even more office space at Pacific Shores. New zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet.

Google — which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom — may have been attracted to the project partly for its water transit possibilities beyond freeways.

Pacific Shores is a half mile from the Port of Redwood City, where a Google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from San Francisco and Alameda to the port.

Mayor Gee said the city would be happy to work with Google on such a plan, should the search company decide to go in that direction.

"Google Said to Buy Redwood City Offices for $585 Million","Google Inc. (GOOG) bought six office buildings northwest of its Silicon Valley headquarters from Starwood Capital Group LLC and Blackstone Group LP (BX) in a $585 million deal, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

The properties are part of the Pacific Shores Center office park in Redwood City, California, about 11 miles (18 kilometers) from Google’s main office in Mountain View, said the people, who asked not to be named because the transaction is private. The company said in its quarterly report filed yesterday that it bought land and buildings for $585 million, without details.

The acquisition extends a real estate deal spree as Google, owner of the world’s largest search engine, expands hiring and makes acquisitions. This month, the company signed office-lease agreements for a total commitment of about $1 billion through 2028, according to the filing.

“We expect to continue to hire aggressively for the remainder of 2014,” Google said in the filing. “Acquisitions will also remain an important component of our strategy.”

The company had 55,030 full-time employees as of Sept. 30, up almost 19 percent from a year earlier, the filing shows.

Meghan Casserly, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment beyond the filing. Tom Johnson, a spokesman for Barry Sternlicht’s Starwood Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Peter Rose, a spokesman for New York-based Blackstone, declined to comment. The Silicon Valley Business Journal reported this month that Google was close to completing a deal at the site.

Fitness Center

The properties Google purchased comprise about 934,200 square feet (86,800 square meters) of Class A office space, as well as a 38,000-square-foot fitness center that includes a gym, pool and spa, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. That’s more than half of the 1.7 million square feet of office space at the complex.

The office building addresses are 1200, 1300, 1600, 1700, 1800, and 1900 Seaport Blvd., the people said.

Pacific Shores Center is a 106-acre (43-hectare) waterfront campus that was developed by San Francisco-based Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s. It lies about halfway between San Francisco and San Jose. The campus, which includes sports fields and a park, is next to restored wetlands that are part of the San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge.

Starwood, Blackstone

Starwood Capital bought Pacific Shores Center in December 2006, near the height of the commercial-property market, from its developer and Walton Street Capital LLC, and immediately resold two of the buildings. Starwood Capital paid about $833 million in the deal, its first office acquisition in the San Francisco Bay area.

Blackstone in 2011 bought an $80 million junior loan on the office complex at a discount in an effort to gain ownership if Starwood Capital defaulted, two people with knowledge of the purchase said at the time. Blackstone then gained an equity stake in the properties sold to Google through a loan restructuring.

Blackstone, through its Equity Office unit, has major office holdings in Northern California and is the second-largest U.S. office landlord, after Brookfield Property Partners LP.

"Hand grenade found at Beckenham Lane property in Shortlands","An unexploded grenade was found at a property in Beckenham Lane in Shortlands earlier today (September 22).

Officers were called to the scene at around 1pm.

"No, that high school kid didn't make $72 million trading stocks","You may have seen the amazing story today about the high school kid who made $72 million trading stocks. There were plenty of red flags in the original New York Magazine article. But now CNBC is reporting that the $72 million figure is totally bogus.

Mohammed Islam, a 17-year-old high school kid in New York, was profiled as a Wall Street whiz kid who was raking in millions. The New York Magazine piece implies that his wealth ($72 million or not) largely came from trading.

Mo got into trading oil and gold, and his bank account grew. Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the ""high eight figures."" More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattan—though his parents won't let him live in it until he turns 18—and acquire a BMW, which he can't drive because he doesn't yet have a license.
But the investment club that Islam belongs to sent a statement to Business Insider:

It has been brought to the attention of the Leaders Investment Club that Mohammed Islam has been rumored to have made $72,000,000 through making trades in the stock market. After performing due diligence and talking with Mohammed Islam himself, we have determined that these claims are false and simply been blown up by the media in the interests of sensationalism.
The journalist who wrote the piece defends it, saying that she saw a bank statement that confirms he's worth eight figures:


So what's the real story? We can only speculate at this point, but if history is any guide for Wall Street prodigy stories, most of his wealth could come from an inheritance. Just last month Yahoo Finance had to issue a correction about the story of a 27-year-old ""self-made"" millionaire. It turned out that probably 80 percent of that man's wealth came from an inheritance.

You can watch video of CNBC discussing the story of Mohammed Islam, the high school millionaire, below:


All this doesn't mean that Islam isn't still making decent coin from his trading, nor that he's not incredibly wealthy. He's just not worth $72 million and almost certainly didn't make the majority of his money trading stocks.

We'll have to wait until the dust settles for the real story on this one, but that could take a while. Islam cancelled an appearance on CNBC after getting spooked by producers in his pre-interview.","1"
"EXCLUSIVE: New York Mag’s Boy Genius Investor Made It All Up","It’s been a tough month for factchecking. After the Rolling Stone campus rape story unraveled, readers of all publications can be forgiven for questioning the process by which Americans get our news. And now it turns out that another blockbuster story is —to quote its subject in an exclusive Observer interview—”not true.”

Monday’s edition of New York magazine includes an irresistible story about a Stuyvesant High senior named Mohammed Islam who had made a fortune investing in the stock market. Reporter Jessica Pressler wrote regarding the precise number, “Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the “’high eight figures.’” The New York Post followed up with a story of its own, with the fat figure playing a key role in the headline: “High school student scores $72M playing the stock market.”

And now it turns out, the real number is … zero.

In an exclusive interview with Mr. Islam and his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov, the baby faced boys who dress in suits with tie clips came clean. Swept up in a tide of media adulation, they made the whole thing up.

Speaking at the offices of their newly hired crisis pr firm, 5WPR and handled by a phalanx of four including the lawyer Ed Mermelstein of RheemBell&Mermelsein, Mr. Islam told a story that will be familiar to just about any 12th grader—a fib turns into a lie turns into a rumor turns into a bunch of mainstream media stories and invitations to appear on CNBC.

Here’s how it happened.

Observer: What was your first contact with the New York magazine reporter?

Mohammed Islam: “My friend’s father worked at New York magazine and he had the reporter contact me. Then she [Jessica Pressler] called me.”

You seem to be quoted saying “eight figures.” That’s not true, is it?

No, it is not true.

The Post trumpeted the boys' investment success, as did New York magazine. (screencap)
The Post trumpeted the boys’ investment success, as did New York magazine. (screencap)

Is there ANY figure? Have you invested and made returns at all?

No.

So it’s total fiction?

Yes.

Are you interested in investing? How did you get this reputation?

I run an investment club at Stuy High which does only simulated trades.”

If you had been playing with real money, would you have done really well?

The simulated trades percentage was extremely high relative to the S&P.

Where did Jessica Pressler come up with the $72 million figure?

I honestly don’t know. The number’s a rumor.

She said ‘have you made $72 million’?

[I led her to believe] I had made even more than $72 million on the simulated trades.

At this point the PR reps jumped in with Law & Order style objections. A conference outside the room ensued. Back into the room came Mr. Islam.

All I can say is for the simulated trades, I was very successful. The returns were incredible and outperformed the S&P.

Damir, tell me where you fit into this.

Damir Tulemaganbetov: Well, I got excited by this whole trading thing and I said hey, let me get on board. I heard about this article coming out and Mohammed invited me and I met Jessica.

But you guys are pals outside of this?

We go to social gatherings and friends’ places.

Are you into stockpicking as well?

I haven’t been into it but I’m interested.

Mohammed, you’re from Queens and you go to this elite public high school. Is this a hobby of your parents as well or would you be the first person in your family to pursue high finance?

Mohammed Islam: In my immediate family, just me.

So what did your parents think when they’re reading that you’ve got $72 million?

Mohammed Islam: Honestly, my dad wanted to disown me. My mom basically said she’d never talk to me. Their morals are that if I lie about it and don’t own up to it then they can no longer trust me. … They knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and I haven’t spoken to them since.

You haven’t? Where did you sleep last night?

Mohammed Islam: At a friend’s house. But we didn’t sleep.

Damir Tulemaganbetov: We stayed awake all night. We’ve been checking out news all over the world.

Are your friends blowing up your phones?

Damir Tulemaganbetov: He had 297 unread messages and 190 LinkedIn. All the friends shared it.

Mohammed Islam: It was hyped up beyond belief.

Damir Tulemaganbetov: We were at CNBC. That’s why we’re dressed up. But we were there and literally in the building stressing out. We had 20 minutes. Then we three times asked them could we have 20 seconds to talk?

[The boys ended up cancelling the CNBC appearance.]

Where do you go from here?

Damir Tulemaganbetov: Socially, people will be mad about it. But we’re sorry. Especially ot our parents. Like my dad would read this and be like ‘Oh My God’ because he’s a very humble man and I portrayed him like a bad father.

Mohammed Islam: At school, first things first. I am incredibly sorry for any misjudgment and any hurt I caused. The people I’m most sorry for is my parents. I did something where I can no longer gain their trust. I have one sister, two years younger, and we don’t really talk.

 

So that’s that. There was no $72 million, no “eight figures,” not even one figure. The story is already coming unglued as the commenters on New York’s site hammer the reporter for even thinking this was possible. New York has now altered its headline to back away from the $72 million figure but the story itself remains. Even if this working-class kid had somehow started with $100,000 as a high school freshman on day one at Stuy High, he’d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796% over the three years since. C’mon, man.

It’s not hard to see why the story was tough to resist for New York, which placed Mr. Islam’s alleged acumen at No. 12 in its 10th annual “Reasons to Love New York” issue. Ms. Pressler quoted him saying, “It’s not just about money. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers …” Yep, nothing says success—or search engine optimization—quite like “Koch brothers.”

No one asked for my opinion, but I’m going to provide it anyway, having sat with these kids for a good bit on a tough day. They got carried away. They’re not children. But they’re not quite adults, either, and at least Mr. Islam was literally quaking as we spoke. So yeah, they probably should have known better. But New York and the New York Post probably should have, as well. This story smelled fishy the instant it appeared and a quick dance with the calculator probably would have saved these young men—and a couple reporters—some embarrassment.

"Whiz kid stock picker: I didn't actually make $72M trading","The improbable story making the rounds today of the 17-year old whiz kid of Wall Street who is rumored to have made $72 million trading the markets, while still in high school, is being widely disputed.

Mohammed Islam, the alleged teenaged prodigy, said he had no idea where that dollar figure came from and that it's not accurate.

Instead the figure is believed to be a few million dollars, but Mr. Islam declined to be more specific.

""The attention is not what we expected – we never wanted the hype. This was about friends trying to make something exciting together, "" Mr. Islam said in an exclusive CNBC interview.

Mr. Islam and one of his colleagues were scheduled to appear on CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" following the publication of a New York Magazine profile. The ensuing publicity however, and pre-interview by CNBC, prompted them to reconsider.

""We expected a regular article about what we hope to do"" in our career, he said. ""The way we were portrayed is not who we are.""","1"
"Mohammed Islam Denies Making $72 Million From Stock Market Trading","Mohammed Islam, the 17-year-old whose profile has circulated across the nation, says he did not make $72 million from trading stocks.

Islam, a high school student at Stuyvesant in New York City, was profiled by the New Yorker, which claimed that he made $72 million from the market.

But Islam told CNBC that the figure is not accurate, although he declined to be more specific other than saying it’s closer to a few million dollars.

“The attention is not what we expected – we never wanted the hype. This was about friends trying to make something exciting together, ” Islam said.

“We expected a regular article about what we hope to do” in our career, he said. “The way we were portrayed is not who we are.”

The New Yorker claimed that it got the figure from rumors.

“Our story portrays the $72 million figure as a rumor; the initial headline has been changed to more clearly reflect the fact that we did not know the exact figure he has made in trades,” it said in a statement. “However, Mohammed provided bank statements that showed he is worth eight figures, and he confirmed on the record that he’s worth eight figures.”

Islam says he would like to become a hedge fund manager, and find a mentor who is a great trader.

His inspiration is Paul Tudor Jones.

Islam, who trades mainly in Crude Oil futures and Gold futures and small to mid-cap equities, told Business Insider he’s already learned a lot.

“When I learned that I needed discipline, a strategy that had been back tested, and enough capital, I buckled down and made sure I didn’t make one more trade until I had done that,” he said.

“I traded using my plan and didn’t go astray and followed the cardinal rule of minimizing losses and maximizing profits. This made me profitable and to this day I look upon that as a major goal I accomplished.”","1"
"Yemen says U.S. man freed, sister says he’s dead","An American hostage in Yemen held by al-Qaeda has been freed, according to statements from the country’s defense ministry on Saturday, however his sister has received information of his death.

The defense ministry said on its website that an operation by Yemen's armed forces early on Saturday freed photojournalist Luke Somers and led to the killing of 10 members of the militant group holding him, according to Reuters news agency. 

It said the operation took place in the Wadi Abdan Al Daqqar region of Shabwa Province in the southern part of the country. 

But his sister Lucy Somers told The Associated Press that she learned of her 33-year-old brother’s death from FBI agents. There was no immediate comment from Washington, nor from security officials in Yemen's capital, Sanaa.

Meanwhile another account suggests Somers was wounded during the operation. 

""American soldiers carried away the hostage. He was wounded and we don't know if he is dead or alive,"" the Yemeni official told Agence France-Presse on condition of anonymity.

Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, where he had been working as a freelance photographer for the Yemen Times.

Al-Qaeda posted a video Thursday that showed Somers, 33, and a local al-Qaeda commander threatening that Somers would meet his fate in three days if the United States doesn’t meet the group’s demands, which weren’t specified.

In a video posted Saturday near London, Lucy Somers describes her older brother as a romantic who “always believes the best in people.” She ends with the plea: “Please let him live.”

In a statement, Somers’ father, Michael, calls his son “a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people” and asks for his safe release.

“When foreign nationals were advised to leave Yemen, Luke refused to go, saying he felt safe and at home there,” Lucy Somers said in her video. “He felt the Yemeni people would look after him.”

“Photojournalism has been his way of highlighting the struggles of the Yemeni people,” she said.

Michael Somers said his son “was confident that no one would harm him for his simplicity and honest friendship to all Yemenis around him.”

Luke Somers “told all his friends and loved ones stories of Yemenis’ generosity, humility and devoted friendship,” his father said, adding, “Luke’s life in Yemen these past three and a half years should not have ended with a kidnapping but with a great reward. The fact that he chose to live in Yemen and not the United States shows where his sympathies lay. Please bring Luke back to us safe and sound.”

Somers’ brother, Jordan, and mother, Paula, offered a similar message in an earlier video.

“My life is in danger,” Luke Somers said in the al-Qaiea footage, which appeared to mimic hostage videos released by al-Qaida’s rival, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group. He asked for help.

In a statement Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby acknowledged for the first time that a raid last month had sought to rescue Somers but that he turned out not to be at the site.

White House spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan also said President Barack Obama had authorized a rescue operation to free Somers and other hostages but “regrettably, Luke was not present.”

US President Barack Obama condemned Mr Somers's death as a ""barbaric murder"".

Analysis: Frank Gardner, BBC Security correspondent

Luke Somers is believed to have been sold on by his abductors to AQAP, described as the most dangerous of all al-Qaeda's regional affiliates.

The group has earned itself millions of dollars by ransoming hostages but the US and British governments refuse to pay, leaving them little room for negotiation.

Experts believe the group may now be looking to compete with Islamic State, in Syria and Iraq, which has gained worldwide notoriety for its extreme violence and cruelty coupled with highly produced videos uploaded on to the internet.

Imminent danger

President Obama said he authorised the raid to rescue Mr Somers and other hostages held in the same location.

He said information had ""indicated that Luke's life was in imminent danger.""

A number of militants were also killed in the operation.

""Terrorists who seek to harm our citizens will feel the long arm of American justice,"" Mr Obama said.

A US official told the New York Times that Mr Somers, 33, was apparently shot by his captors as the raid unfolded and was badly wounded when the US forces reached him.

'Devastation'

Meanwhile there are reports that Mr Korkie was expected to be released on Sunday.

He was abducted with his wife Yolande in May last year in Yemen's second city, Taiz.

She was freed on 10 January without ransom and returned to South Africa.

""We received with sadness the news that Pierre was killed in an attempt by American Special Forces, in the early hours of this morning, to free hostages in Yemen,"" the charity Gift of the Givers said in a statement.

Yemen isn't the most difficult place to live in. Always something to make you smile, you just sometimes have to step outside and find it.

But soon enough, I need to depart and spend some time with my mom!

His sister Lucy Somers told Associated Press that she learned of her brother's death from FBI agents at 5am this morning.

'We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,' she said from London.

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel this morning confirmed Mr Somers and a second hostage being held by terrorists in Yemen were 'murdered' during a rescue attempt ordered by President Barack Obama.

Hagel said there were 'compelling reasons to believe Somers' life was in imminent danger.'

British-born U.S. photojournalist Luke Somers (pictured), who was being held by al-Qaida militants in Yemen, has been killed in a failed rescue attempt, his sister has revealed today

Luke Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 from Yemen's capital Sana'a (shown in the map above)

Mr Somers moved from London to Sana'a, Yemen in 2011 to become a teacher, but soon started taking pictures of public demonstrations and established himself as a photojournalist working for the Yemen Times

He said Mr Somers and a second non-U.S. citizen were 'murdered by AQAP terrorists during the mission.' Hagel said that several terrorists were also killed in the mission carried out by U.S. special forces.

The humanitarian group Gift of Givers has said today that teacher Pierre Korkie was shot dead in crossfire during the bid to rescue Mr Somers - just a day before he was set to be freed.

Mr Korkie and his wife Yolande were reportedly captured by militants in May 2013 in Ta'iz, Yemen. But his wife was released after Gift of the Givers helped negotiate her freedom.

Earlier this week al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) issued a video with a message aimed at the US government threatening to kill Mr Somers if its demands were not met.

Last week the U.S. said it had attempted a rescue operation to free a number of hostages, including Mr Somers, but that he had not been at the site of the raid.

South African Pierre Korkie was killed in the attempted rescue mission by the United States - just a day before he was due to be released

South African Pierre Korkie was killed in the attempted rescue mission by the United States - just a day before he was due to be released, an aid group says.

Mr Korkie was killed in the failed effort to release hostages, Imtiaz Sooliman, founder of the Gift of the Givers group told the South African Press Agency.

Korkie was to be freed by al-Qaida on Sunday, Gift of the Givers said on Twitter.

'Leaders met in Aden this morning, preparing final security and logistical arrangements 2 bring Pierre 2 safety & freedom,' said tweeted the aid group.

Mr Korkie and his wife Yolande were taken hostage in Taiz, Yemen, in May 2013, the charity said.

A team had met in Aden this morning, preparing final security and logistical arrangements 2 bring the hostage to freedom, it claimed.

'It is even more tragic that the words we used in a conversation with Yolande at 5.59 this morning was ""the wait is almost over"",' the charity tweeted to its 7,500 followers.

It added: 'All logistical arrangements were in place 2 safely fly Pierre out of Yemen under diplomatic cover.'

At the time of the kidnapping, Mr Korkie was a teacher in Yemen, while his wife was working in hospitals, News24 reports.

The family of Mr Somers had earlier pleaded for him to be released.

In an online video Miss Somers described her older brother as a romantic who 'always believes the best in people.' She added: 'Please let him live.'

His father Michael said Mr Somers was 'a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people'.

It came after the release of the AQAP video which begins with a reading in Arabic from Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, an AQAP official, before Mr Somers appears and gives a statement in English.

He said: 'My name is Luke Somers. I'm 33 years old. I was born in England, but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life.

'It's now been well over a year since I've been kidnapped in Sana'a. Basically, I'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I'm certain that my life is in danger.

'So as I sit here now, I ask if anything can be done, please let it be done. Thank you very much.'

Al Ansi gave the US government three days to meet the demands or 'otherwise, the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate'.

Militants released a video on Thursday that showed Mr Somers, threatening to kill him in three days if the United States did not meet the group's demands

Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, senior official in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, pictured, spoke for two minutes and thirty seconds during the video where he threatened to kill Mr Somers within three days

The three-minute video also features Ansi speaking about American activity in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq as well as recent air strikes in Syria.

It follows similar videos by another extremist militant group, Islamic State (IS), which has already killed two British hostages and three American hostages in videos released on social media.

IS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning.

Footage claiming to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq.

The news of the failed rescue comes after a suspected U.S. drone strike in Yemen killed nine alleged al-Qaida militants early Saturday, a security official said.

The drone struck at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, hitting a suspected militant hideout, the official said.

American commandos tried to rescue Mr Somers in a raid on an AQAP camp late last month, but he had been moved by the time they arrived

Begging for mercy: Luke's brother, Jordan (left), and his mother, Paula Somers (right), released a video on Thursday asking his al-Qaeda captors to release him

The official did not elaborate and spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorised to brief journalists.

At least six suspected militants were killed in an airstrike in the same province last month.

Later Saturday, tribal leaders said they saw helicopters flying over an area called Wadi Abdan in Shabwa province.

American authorities rarely discuss their drone strike campaign in Yemen.

The strikes are incredibly unpopular in Yemen due to civilian casualties, legitimising for many the attacks on American interests.

In a statement on Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby acknowledged for the first time that a mysterious U.S. raid last month had sought to rescue Mr Somers but that he turned out not to be at the site.

Kirby did not elaborate on the joint U.S-Yemeni operation to free Mr Somers, saying details remained classified.

However, officials have said the raid targeted a remote al-Qaida safe haven in a desert region near the Saudi border. Eight captives - including Yemenis, a Saudi and an Ethiopian - were freed.

Mr Somers, a Briton and four others had been moved days earlier.

Mr Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 as he left a supermarket in the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, said Fakhri al-Arashi, chief editor of the National Yemen, where Mr Somers worked as a copy editor and a freelance photographer during the 2011 uprising in Yemen.

Luke Somers had been held hostage since September 2013 in Yemen's capital Sana'a having moved to the country two years earlier.

The 33-year-old was reportedly shot by his captors as US commandos carried out a dramatic rescue bid in the southern Shabwa province late on Friday night.

Reports have now emerged that South African hostage Pierre Korkie was also killed during the operation - a day before he was due to be released.

"REVEALED Navy Seals got within 100 yards of Yemen compound where U.S. photojournalist was being held - before al-Qaeda captors realised and shot him dead","A British-born U.S. photojournalist and a South African aid worker held hostage in Yemen by al Qaeda militants have been 'murdered' in a failed rescue attempt.

American citizen Luke Somers had been held hostage since September 2013 in Yemen's capital Sana'a having moved to the country two years earlier.

The 33-year-old was reportedly shot by his captors as Navy SEAL Team six, made up of around 40 men, carried out a dramatic rescue bid in the southern Shabwa province late on Friday night - the second attempted extraction by special forces in as many months.

Another hostage, South African aid worker Pierre Korkie, was also killed during the operation - a day before he was due to be released.

According to CNN the commandos hiked for six miles to reach the village where he was being held. They were only 100 yards away from the compound when they were spotted - prompting the militants to shoot the pair.

Two medics involved in the operation tried to revive both of the hostages, but one died at the scene while the other succumbed to his injuries on the operating table inside the USS Makin Island.

Outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel confirmed Mr Somers death this morning as he landed in Afghanistan.

Lucy Somers said she learned of her 33-year-old brother Luke Somers' death from FBI agents

In April 2013 he took photos of a protest by Yemenis, demanding the release of Guantanamo Bay trainees

During a press conference he announced that 1,000 more US troops than expected will be stationed in the country next year following a spike in Taliban attacks.

Mr Somers was badly wounded when commandos found him and he died from his injuries by the time he had been flown to a naval ship.

Mr Somers' sister Lucy Somers told Associated Press that she learned of her brother's death from FBI agents at 5am this morning. 'We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,' she said from London.

An Osprey aircraft took a team of U.S. Navy SEALS to the location, which was close to the site where a previous rescue mission had taken place, officials told CNN.

A gun fight is understood to have unfolded before the badly injured hostages were taken away on the aircraft, the report says.

Four Yemeni and CTU agents were wounded during the operation.

According to the New York Times the forces raided four houses in the village where the attack took place, killed and least two militants but also gunned down eight civilians.

Mr Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 as he left a supermarket in the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, said Fakhri al-Arashi, chief editor of the National Yemen.

He had moved to the country in 2010 to teach English as the Arab Spring started to develop but soon became one of the country's only foreign photographers.

The hostage worked at the paper as a copy editor and a freelance photographer during the 2011 uprising in Yemen.

There are reports Mr Somers was sold to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) - one of the most dangerous regional arms of the terrorist group.

The organisation make millions ransoming hostages - but British and American governments refuse to pay.

On November 25, U.S Special Forces sent a unit to a cave near the Yemen border with Saudi Arabia in a hope of retrieving Mr Somers. Seven hostages were saved and eight militants were killed but the journalist was not inside.

The U.S. considers Yemen's al-Qaeda branch to be the world's most dangerous arm of the group as it has been linked to several failed attacks on the U.S. homeland.

Hagel this morning confirmed Mr Somers and a second hostage being held by terrorists in Yemen were 'murdered' during a rescue attempt ordered by the President.

Hagel said that several terrorists were also killed in the mission carried out by U.S. special forces.

The outgoing Pentagon head said the raid was 'well-executed' and based on better intelligence forces had received in the last 24 hours.

He made the announcement just hours before holding a press conference with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani - during which he confirmed 10,800 troops will still be in Afghanistan in 2015.

The original plan was to cut the number down to 9,800.

'It's predictable that they would do everything they could and continue to do to try to disrupt and discourage the new government of President Ghani,' he said.

The news of the hostage's death came as U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel made an unannounced visit to Kabul to meet Afghan President Ghani and announce that more troops than expected will be stationed in the country in 2015

The outgoing Pentagon head said a recent spike in attacks by the Taliban proved that they were trying to disrupt the transition into the new government

The Defense Department said the rise in violence did not prompt the decision to keep troops in the country.

An official statement said it was due to the late signing of the Bilateral Security Agreement, which allows a specified amount of U.S. troops to remain after the combat mission ends this year.

Hamid Karzai, Ghani's predecessor, refused to sign the deal.

According to The Pentagon, 99 per cent of Afghan forces are now taking the lead in missions and are performing 'well'.

By 2016 the number of troops will have decreased to 5,500 before a further transition to power in Kabul by 2017.

Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement today saying Somers' murder 'is a reminder of the brutality of the terrorists of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. They have again demonstrated their cruelty and their disdain for human life, freedom, and the Yemeni people whom they terrorize daily.

Kerry said he's 'proud of the brave men and women of the U.S. military who twice risked their lives in operations to try and bring Luke home safely.

'We also appreciate the efforts of the dedicated intelligence, law enforcement, and diplomatic professionals who supported these operations, and we are particularly grateful to the Yemeni government, under the leadership of President Hadi, for their critical and supportive role in trying to liberate this young American from unfathomable captivity, and for their enduring partnership in combating the scourge of AQAP.'

The AWAP terrorists know 'how to hate, they know how to murder, and now they have robbed a family of an idealistic young photojournalist who went to Yemen to practice his calling and document the lives of ordinary Yemenis,' Kerry said.

British Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond said: 'My deepest condolences are with the families of both hostages at this time. We utterly condemn AQAP for the brutal murder of these two men.

'Luke had close links with the UK and his family have spoken about Luke's life and his work, and that is how he should be remembered.

Luke Somers had been working as a freelance photographer when he was captured, and those who knew him say he had 'wanderlust' and was drawn to new experiences.

Mr Somers, who was born in Britain, earned a bachelor's degree in creative writing while attending Beloit College in Wisconsin from 2004 through 2007.

'He really wanted to understand the world,' said Shawn Gillen, an English professor and chairman of Beloit College's journalism program.

Fuad Al Kadas, who said Somers is one of his best friends, said Somers spent time in Egypt before finding work in Yemen. Somers started teaching English at a Yemen school but quickly established himself as a one of the few foreign photographers in the country, he said.

'He is a great man with a kind heart who really loves the Yemeni people and the country,' Al Kadas wrote in an email from Yemen. He said he last saw Somers the day before he was kidnapped.

'He was so dedicated in trying to help change Yemen's future, to do good things for the people that he didn't leave the country his entire time here,' Al Kadas wrote.

Al Kadas said in Yemen, Somers enjoyed making friends with neighbors, youth activists and ordinary people.

American commandos tried to rescue Mr Somers (pcitred) in a raid on an AQAP camp late last month, but he had been moved by the time they arrived

Gillen said Somers wanted to seek out experiences that would matter to him, noting he traveled to Egypt as part of the school's study abroad program. The professor said he wasn't surprised when he heard Somers had moved to Yemen.

'He'd want to be in places where world events were happening,' the professor said, adding that liberal arts instructors want their students 'to go on and lead meaningful, purposeful lives. Luke was trying to do that. That makes (his capture) all the more horrible for us to ponder.'

Gillen said Somers was in his advanced non-fiction writing course and a small-group seminar that focused on William Butler Yeats and James Joyce. He said Somers would often stop by his office just to chat.

'He would come by and say, 'I was walking across campus and I was thinking about something Joyce wrote,' and he'd want to talk about it. In many ways that's a professor's dream come true,' Gillen said.

Friends of Mr Somers (pictured) said he had 'wanderlust' and was drawn to new experiences

In 2007, Somers worked as an editor at The Teaching Drum Outdoors School in Three Lakes, Wisconsin.

Tamarack Song, the school's director, said Somers was hired to edit a book for the school. He came to the school with his girlfriend who also was an editor.

'He was born in England, raised in America. He had wanderlust,' Song said. 'He wanted to know what made people tick. He has an undying curiosity for human dynamics and for the way people worked. He was constantly doing research.'

Song said he thought Yemen and the Middle East was a symbol for Somers, and that Somers wanted to be at the epicenter of culture and ideology.

Song said he speculates that Somers went 'to be where the action was, to get a feel for the pulse of contemporary conflict.'

'He wanted to be in the center of things, and to get a feel for it. To get closer and closer, to interview people, to research, to write, to get right there,' Song said.

Penny Bearman, the step-mother of the hostage, paid tribute to her husband's son following his death.

She told ITV News: 'Luke’s taste for travel grew early on in life. He was born in London to an American Mother who returned to the States with him when he was 7 years old, visiting his father each year in Deal, Kent.

'As a young man he worked Salmon Fishing in the Arctic, lived for a time in Jamaica, witnessed riots in Cairo and moved to Yemen in 2011.

'He was a talented photographer with a sensitivity for people and people’s lives and made a considerable contribution as a photo journalist in telling the stories of communities in war-torn areas.

'I think Luke would have wanted issues of extremism and terrorism to be addressed by stepping up the dialogue instead of resorting to conflict between nations.'

During his time in Trenchtown, a municipality in Jamaica, he was involved in a number of projects where he captured photos of citizens around the town.

IS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning.

Foley, who was beheaded in by the terrorists in August, was reportedly the subject of another failed rescue mission in July.

Following his death, White House counterterrorism adviser told the press: 'The U.S. government had what we believed was sufficient intelligence, and when the opportunity presented itself, the president authorized the Department of Defense to move aggressively to recover our citizens.

'Unfortunately, that mission was ultimately not successful because the hostages were not present.'

The Obama administration was accused of knowing where Foley was five weeks before the extraction attempt in July and questions have been raised as to why they hesitated.

A former military official told Fox that when the team 'finally did go' into Syria to try and save Foley and a number of other hostages they felt the intelligence was 'drying up'.

Footage claiming to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq.

The news of the failed rescue comes after a suspected U.S. drone strike in Yemen killed nine alleged al-Qaeda militants early Saturday, a security official said.

The drone struck at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, hitting a suspected militant hideout, the official said.

The official did not elaborate and spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorised to brief journalists.

At least six suspected militants were killed in an airstrike in the same province last month.

Later Saturday, tribal leaders said they saw helicopters flying over an area called Wadi Abdan in Shabwa province.

American authorities rarely discuss their drone strike campaign in Yemen.

The strikes are incredibly unpopular in Yemen due to civilian casualties, legitimising for many the attacks on American interests.

In a statement on Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby acknowledged for the first time that a mysterious U.S. raid last month had sought to rescue Mr Somers but that he turned out not to be at the site.

Kirby did not elaborate on the joint U.S-Yemeni operation to free Mr Somers, saying details remained classified.

However, officials have said the raid targeted a remote al-Qaeda safe haven in a desert region near the Saudi border. Eight captives - including Yemenis, a Saudi and an Ethiopian - were freed.

Mr Somers, and five others had been moved days earlier

After hearing of Luke Somers' death, friend and colleague Tik Root paid tribute to the photojournalist on PBS.

He said: 'Luke never wavered from the front lines. He spent countless hours documenting revolutionaries in Sanaa's Change Square and snapped photos ranging from Yemen's former president to children afflicted with malnutrition.

'His work provides a gripping window into a country rarely on the world's radar. It also reveals his deep and persistent love for the country.

'I knew Luke. Not particularly well. But during my 15 months as a fellow freelancer in Yemen, we crossed paths on perhaps a dozen or so occasions — both social and professional. Quirky, passionate and thoughtful, he also struck me as a fairly private guy.'

He also revealed some of the pictures he liked while Mr Somers worked with Demotix.

Here is a collection of his work while in the Middle East - including striking photos of children, protesters and politicians.

"REVEALED: Navy Seals hiked six miles and got within 100 yards of Yemen compound where executed US hostage was being held - before a 'dog bark' alerted al-Qaeda captors","A British-born U.S. photojournalist and a South African aid worker held hostage in Yemen by al Qaeda militants have been 'murdered' in a failed rescue attempt.

American citizen Luke Somers had been held hostage since September 2013 in Yemen's capital Sana'a having moved to the country two years earlier.

The 33-year-old was reportedly shot by his captors as Navy SEAL Team six, made up of around 40 men, carried out a dramatic rescue bid in the Wadi Abdan region of the southern Shabwa province late on Friday night.

It is the second attempted extraction by special forces in as many months.

Another hostage, South African aid worker Pierre Korkie, was also killed during the operation - a day before he was due to be released.

According to the Wall Street Journal the commandos hiked for six miles through a mountain range to reach the village where he was being held.

Lucy Somers said she learned of her 33-year-old brother Luke Somers' death from FBI agents

In April 2013 he took photos of a protest by Yemenis, demanding the release of Guantanamo Bay trainees

They were only 100 yards away from the compound when the terrorists reportedly heard a dog bark - prompting the militants to shoot the pair dead.

Two medics involved in the operation tried to revive both of the hostages, but one died at the scene while the other succumbed to his injuries on the operating table inside the USS Makin Island.

Outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel confirmed Mr Somers death this morning as he landed in Afghanistan.

During a press conference he announced that 1,000 more US troops than expected will be stationed in the country next year following a spike in Taliban attacks.

Mr Somers was badly wounded when commandos found him and he died from his injuries by the time he had been flown to a naval ship.

Mr Somers' sister Lucy Somers told Associated Press that she learned of her brother's death from FBI agents at 5am this morning. 'We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,' she said from London.

An Osprey aircraft took a team of U.S. Navy SEALS to the location, which was close to the site where a previous rescue mission had taken place, officials told CNN.

A gun fight is understood to have unfolded before the badly injured hostages were taken away on the aircraft, the report says.

Four Yemeni and CTU agents were wounded during the operation.

According to the New York Times the forces raided four houses in the village where the attack took place, killed six militants but also gunned down eight civilians.

Mr Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 as he left a supermarket in the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, said Fakhri al-Arashi, chief editor of the National Yemen.

He had moved to the country in 2010 to teach English as the Arab Spring started to develop but soon became one of the country's only foreign photographers.

The hostage worked at the paper as a copy editor and a freelance photographer during the 2011 uprising in Yemen.

There are reports Mr Somers was sold to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) - one of the most dangerous regional arms of the terrorist group.

The organisation make millions ransoming hostages - but British and American governments refuse to pay.

On November 25, U.S Special Forces sent a unit to a cave near the Yemen border with Saudi Arabia in a hope of retrieving Mr Somers. Seven hostages were saved and eight militants were killed but the journalist was not inside.

The U.S. considers Yemen's al-Qaeda branch to be the world's most dangerous arm of the group as it has been linked to several failed attacks on the U.S. homeland.

Barack Obama described Mr Somers' murder as 'barbaric' in a statement this morning.

'On behalf of the American people, I offer my deepest condolences to Luke's family and to his loved ones,' he said in a statement.

British-born U.S. photojournalist Luke Somers (pictured), who was being held by al-Qaeda militants in Yemen, has been killed in a failed rescue attempt, his sister has revealed today

Luke Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 from Yemen's capital Sana'a (shown in the map above)

Mr Somers moved from London to Sana'a, Yemen in 2010 to become a teacher, but soon started taking pictures of public demonstrations and established himself as a photojournalist working for the Yemen Times

The photojournalist bends down to take a picture during the National Dialogue Conference in Sanaa in July 2013, weeks before he was captured

'As this and previous hostage rescue operations demonstrate, the United States will spare no effort to use all of its military, intelligence and diplomatic capabilities to bring Americans home safely, wherever they are located.

'And terrorists who seek to harm our citizens will feel the long arm of American justice,' he said.

President Obama said he authorised the raid on Friday to rescue Somers and other hostages held in the same location. He said the United States had used every tool at its disposal to secure Somers' release since his capture 15 months ago.

He also thanked the Yemen government for its support. It is understood that the U.S. personnel who carried out the raid are safe.

'Luke was a photojournalist who sought through his images to convey the lives of Yemenis to the outside world,' President Obama said.

'The callous disregard for Luke's life is more proof of the depths of AQAP's depravity, and further reason why the world must never cease in seeking to defeat their evil ideology,' he said.

Hagel this morning confirmed Mr Somers and a second hostage being held by terrorists in Yemen were 'murdered' during a rescue attempt ordered by the President.

Hagel said that several terrorists were also killed in the mission carried out by U.S. special forces.

The outgoing Pentagon head said the raid was 'well-executed' and based on better intelligence forces had received in the last 24 hours.

He made the announcement just hours before holding a press conference with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani - during which he confirmed 10,800 troops will still be in Afghanistan in 2015.

The original plan was to cut the number down to 9,800.

'It's predictable that they would do everything they could and continue to do to try to disrupt and discourage the new government of President Ghani,' he said.

The news of the hostage's death came as U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel made an unannounced visit to Kabul to meet Afghan President Ghani and announce that more troops than expected will be stationed in the country in 2015

The outgoing Pentagon head said a recent spike in attacks by the Taliban proved that they were trying to disrupt the transition into the new government

The Defense Department said the rise in violence did not prompt the decision to keep troops in the country.

An official statement said it was due to the late signing of the Bilateral Security Agreement, which allows a specified amount of U.S. troops to remain after the combat mission ends this year.

Hamid Karzai, Ghani's predecessor, refused to sign the deal.

According to The Pentagon, 99 per cent of Afghan forces are now taking the lead in missions and are performing 'well'.

By 2016 the number of troops will have decreased to 5,500 before a further transition to power in Kabul by 2017.

Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement today saying Somers' murder 'is a reminder of the brutality of the terrorists of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. They have again demonstrated their cruelty and their disdain for human life, freedom, and the Yemeni people whom they terrorize daily.'

Kerry said he's 'proud of the brave men and women of the U.S. military who twice risked their lives in operations to try and bring Luke home safely.

'We also appreciate the efforts of the dedicated intelligence, law enforcement, and diplomatic professionals who supported these operations, and we are particularly grateful to the Yemeni government, under the leadership of President Hadi, for their critical and supportive role in trying to liberate this young American from unfathomable captivity, and for their enduring partnership in combating the scourge of AQAP.'

The AWAP terrorists know 'how to hate, they know how to murder, and now they have robbed a family of an idealistic young photojournalist who went to Yemen to practice his calling and document the lives of ordinary Yemenis,' Kerry said.

Vice President Joe Biden said the U.S. would be relentless in its efforts to bring the killers of an American photojournalist to justice.

Echoing the words of the President he called the killing of Mr Somers a 'despicable crime'.

He says U.S. special forces soldiers 'inflicted serious damage' on Somers captors.

Biden commented Saturday during a previously scheduled address to a Washington conference on U.S.-Israeli relations.

South African Pierre Korkie was killed in the attempted rescue mission by the United States - just a day before he was due to be released, an aid group says.

Mr Korkie was killed in the failed effort to release hostages, Imtiaz Sooliman, founder of the Gift of the Givers group told the South African Press Agency.

Korkie was to be freed by al-Qaeda on Sunday, Gift of the Givers said on Twitter.

South African Pierre Korkie was killed in the attempted rescue mission by the United States - just a day before he was due to be released. His wife Yolande is pictured right

'Leaders met in Aden this morning, preparing final security and logistical arrangements 2 bring Pierre 2 safety & freedom,' said tweeted the aid group.

Mr Korkie and his wife Yolande were taken hostage in Taiz, Yemen, in May 2013, the charity said.

A team had met in Aden this morning, preparing final security and logistical arrangements 2 bring the hostage to freedom, it claimed.

'It is even more tragic that the words we used in a conversation with Yolande at 5.59 this morning was 'the wait is almost over',' the charity tweeted to its 7,500 followers.

It added:'Three days ago we told her 'Pierre will be home for Christmas'.

'We certainly did not mean it in the manner it has unfolded.

'All logistical arrangements were in place 2 safely fly Pierre out of Yemen under diplomatic cover.'

At the time of the kidnapping, Mr Korkie was a teacher in Yemen, while his wife was working in hospitals, News24 reports.

Those close to Mr Korkie said al-Qaeda militants had demanded a $3million ransom for his release.

British Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond said: 'My deepest condolences are with the families of both hostages at this time. We utterly condemn AQAP for the brutal murder of these two men.

'Luke had close links with the UK and his family have spoken about Luke's life and his work, and that is how he should be remembered.

'I salute the forces involved, who showed great courage in carrying out this mission. We continue to work with our international and Yemeni partners to counter the threat from Al Qaida and other terrorist groups.'

The humanitarian group Gift of Givers said today that teacher Pierre Korkie was shot dead during the bid to rescue Mr Somers - just a day before he was set to be freed.

Mr Korkie and his wife Yolande were reportedly captured by militants in May 2013 in Ta'iz, Yemen. But his wife was released after Gift of the Givers helped negotiate her freedom.

On Friday, a team of local leaders was finalizing arrangements to reunite Pierre Korkie to his wife and children, the statement reads.

The charity recently told his wife that 'the wait is almost over.'

Militants released a video on Thursday that showed Mr Somers, threatening to kill him in three days if the United States did not meet the group's demands

'Three days ago we told her 'Pierre will be home for Christmas,'' the group said. 'We certainly did not mean it in the manner it has unfolded.'

Yemen's national security chief, Major General Ali al-Ahmadi, said the militants planned to kill Luke Somers on Saturday, meaning the American and Yemeni forces faced a race against time.

'Al-Qaeda promised to conduct the execution (of Somers) today so there was an attempt to save them but unfortunately they shot the hostage before or during the attack, al-Ahmadi said at a conference in Manama, Bahrain.

Earlier this week al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) issued a video with a message aimed at the US government threatening to kill Mr Somers if its demands were not met.

Last week the U.S. said it had attempted a rescue operation to free a number of hostages, including Mr Somers, but that he had not been at the site of the raid.

The family of Mr Somers had earlier pleaded for him to be released.

In an online video Miss Somers described her older brother as a romantic who 'always believes the best in people.' She added: 'Please let him live.'

His father Michael said Mr Somers was 'a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people'.

It came after the release of the AQAP video which begins with a reading in Arabic from Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, an AQAP official, before Mr Somers appears and gives a statement in English.

Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, senior official in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, pictured, spoke for two minutes and thirty seconds during the video where he threatened to kill Mr Somers within three days

He said: 'My name is Luke Somers. I'm 33 years old. I was born in England, but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life.

'It's now been well over a year since I've been kidnapped in Sana'a. Basically, I'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I'm certain that my life is in danger.

'So as I sit here now, I ask if anything can be done, please let it be done. Thank you very much.'

Al Ansi gave the US government three days to meet the demands or 'otherwise, the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate'.

The three-minute video also features Ansi speaking about American activity in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq as well as recent air strikes in Syria.

It follows similar videos by another extremist militant group, Islamic State (IS), which has already killed two British hostages and three American hostages in videos released on social media.

Luke Somers had been working as a freelance photographer when he was captured, and those who knew him say he had 'wanderlust' and was drawn to new experiences.

Mr Somers, who was born in Britain, earned a bachelor's degree in creative writing while attending Beloit College in Wisconsin from 2004 through 2007.

'He really wanted to understand the world,' said Shawn Gillen, an English professor and chairman of Beloit College's journalism program.

Fuad Al Kadas, who said Somers is one of his best friends, said Somers spent time in Egypt before finding work in Yemen. Somers started teaching English at a Yemen school but quickly established himself as a one of the few foreign photographers in the country, he said.

'He is a great man with a kind heart who really loves the Yemeni people and the country,' Al Kadas wrote in an email from Yemen. He said he last saw Somers the day before he was kidnapped.

'He was so dedicated in trying to help change Yemen's future, to do good things for the people that he didn't leave the country his entire time here,' Al Kadas wrote.

Al Kadas said in Yemen, Somers enjoyed making friends with neighbors, youth activists and ordinary people.

American commandos tried to rescue Mr Somers (pcitred) in a raid on an AQAP camp late last month, but he had been moved by the time they arrived

Gillen said Somers wanted to seek out experiences that would matter to him, noting he traveled to Egypt as part of the school's study abroad program. The professor said he wasn't surprised when he heard Somers had moved to Yemen.

'He'd want to be in places where world events were happening,' the professor said, adding that liberal arts instructors want their students 'to go on and lead meaningful, purposeful lives. Luke was trying to do that. That makes (his capture) all the more horrible for us to ponder.'

Gillen said Somers was in his advanced non-fiction writing course and a small-group seminar that focused on William Butler Yeats and James Joyce. He said Somers would often stop by his office just to chat.

'He would come by and say, 'I was walking across campus and I was thinking about something Joyce wrote,' and he'd want to talk about it. In many ways that's a professor's dream come true,' Gillen said.

Friends of Mr Somers (pictured) said he had 'wanderlust' and was drawn to new experiences

In 2007, Somers worked as an editor at The Teaching Drum Outdoors School in Three Lakes, Wisconsin.

Tamarack Song, the school's director, said Somers was hired to edit a book for the school. He came to the school with his girlfriend who also was an editor.

'He was born in England, raised in America. He had wanderlust,' Song said. 'He wanted to know what made people tick. He has an undying curiosity for human dynamics and for the way people worked. He was constantly doing research.'

Song said he thought Yemen and the Middle East was a symbol for Somers, and that Somers wanted to be at the epicenter of culture and ideology.

Song said he speculates that Somers went 'to be where the action was, to get a feel for the pulse of contemporary conflict.'

'He wanted to be in the center of things, and to get a feel for it. To get closer and closer, to interview people, to research, to write, to get right there,' Song said.

Penny Bearman, the step-mother of the hostage, paid tribute to her husband's son following his death.

She told ITV News: 'Luke's taste for travel grew early on in life. He was born in London to an American Mother who returned to the States with him when he was 7 years old, visiting his father each year in Deal, Kent.

'As a young man he worked Salmon Fishing in the Arctic, lived for a time in Jamaica, witnessed riots in Cairo and moved to Yemen in 2011.

'He was a talented photographer with a sensitivity for people and people's lives and made a considerable contribution as a photo journalist in telling the stories of communities in war-torn areas.

"US hostage 'murdered' by militants in Yemen, says Hagel","Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Saturday that US journalist Luke Somers was killed by militants during an operation aimed at freeing him from his Al-Qaeda kidnappers in Yemen.

""US Special Operations Forces conducted a mission in Yemen to rescue a US citizen, Luke Somers, and any other foreign nationals held hostage with him by Al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) terrorists,"" Hagel said in a statement released during a visit to Kabul.

Hagel added that Friday's operation was undertaken when ""there were compelling reasons to believe Mr. Somers' life was in imminent danger.""

""Several of the AQAP terrorists holding the hostages captive were killed in the mission,"" he said.

""The rescue attempt took place in central Yemen and was conducted in partnership with the Government of Yemen.

"US, South African hostages killed in Yemen rescue bid","American journalist Luke Somers and a South African hostage were killed on Saturday during a failed attempt by US forces to rescue them from Al-Qaeda militants in Yemen.

Somers's death was announced by US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, who said the raid was carried out because the photojournalist's life was believed to be ""in imminent danger"".

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had on Thursday threatened to execute Somers, 33, who was kidnapped more than a year ago in Sanaa.

South African hostage Pierre Korkie was also killed in the raid, according to a charity that had been negotiating his release.

The Gift of the Givers said that Korkie's death came a day before he was due to be freed after more than a year in captivity.

""The psychological and emotional devastation to (his wife) Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was to be released by Al-Qaeda tomorrow,"" it said.

Ten militants were killed in the joint operation in Shabwa province in southeast Yemen, Yemen's defence ministry said.

A tribal leader said soldiers were seen parachuting into the area.

Heavy clashes ensued in Nusab, a militant stronghold, according to residents who reported hearing loud explosions.

Hagel said the rescue attempt was conducted in partnership with the Yemeni government.

The operation ""is a reminder of America's unrelenting commitment to the safety of our fellow citizens -- wherever they might be around the world,"" he added.

- Deadliest Qaeda affiliate -

The United States has said that American and Yemeni forces had already tried unsuccessfully to rescue Somers last month.

According to Yemen's defence ministry, Al-Qaeda moved hostages, including the US journalist, a Briton and a South African, days before that US-Yemeni raid in southeastern Hadramawt province.

Yemeni officials said eight other hostages were freed in the earlier operation.

Yemen is a key US ally in the fight against Al-Qaeda, allowing Washington to conduct a longstanding drone war against the group on its territory.

AQAP is considered by Washington to be the most dangerous affiliate of Al-Qaeda.

The execution threat by AQAP followed the murder of five Western hostages since August by the Islamic State group that controls parts of Syria and Iraq.

Two US journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, American aid worker Peter Kassig and British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines were all beheaded.

Al-Qaeda has exploited instability in impoverished Yemen since a 2011 uprising forced president Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down.

In recent years there has been a growing number of abductions in Yemen by Al-Qaeda.

The militants remain active in southern and eastern regions of Yemen despite several military campaigns by government forces.

Al-Qaeda militants have allied with Sunni tribesmen in southern Yemen to halt the advance of Shiite Huthi militias who seized Sanaa in September unopposed, and who have since extended their control to coastal areas and regions south of the capital.

""The psychological and emotional devastation to (his wife) Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was to be released by Al-Qaeda tomorrow,"" it said.

The South African couple, who had worked as teachers in Yemen for four years, were seized by Al-Qaeda in May 2013 in the city of Taez. The wife was released in January following mediation by Gift of the Givers.

The charity said logistical arrangements had already been put in place to fly Pierre Korkie out of Yemen under diplomatic cover after negotiations.

""It is even more tragic that the words we used in a conversation with Yolande at 5.59 this morning was 'the wait is almost over'.

""Three days ago we told her 'Pierre will be home for Christmas'. We certainly did not mean it in the manner it has unfolded.""

Ten militants were killed in the joint operation in Shabwa province in southeast Yemen, Yemen's defence ministry said.

A tribal leader said soldiers were seen parachuting into the area and residents reported heavy clashes.

- 'Despicable terrorist organisation' -

Obama said that since the abduction of Somers 15 months ago, Washington had been using ""every tool at our disposal"" to try to secure his release.

""Luke was a photojournalist who sought through his images to convey the lives of Yemenis to the outside world,"" Obama added.

""He came to Yemen in peace and was held against his will and threatened by a despicable terrorist organisation.""

Washington has a long-standing policy of not negotiating with hostage-takers or paying ransoms.

The United States has said that American and Yemeni forces had already tried unsuccessfully to rescue Somers last month.

According to Yemen's defence ministry, Al-Qaeda moved hostages, including the US journalist, a Briton and a South African, days before that US-Yemeni raid in southeastern Hadramawt province.

The whereabouts of the Briton are unknown.

Yemeni officials said eight other hostages were freed in the earlier operation.

Yemen is a key US ally in the fight against Al-Qaeda, allowing Washington to conduct a long-standing drone war against the group on its territory.

AQAP is considered by Washington to be the most dangerous affiliate of Al-Qaeda.

The execution threat by AQAP followed the murder of five Western hostages since August by the Islamic State group that controls parts of Syria and Iraq.

Two US journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, American aid worker Peter Kassig and British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines were all beheaded.

Al-Qaeda has exploited instability in impoverished Yemen since a 2011 uprising forced president Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down.

In recent years there has been a growing number of abductions in Yemen by Al-Qaeda.

The militants remain active in southern and eastern regions of Yemen despite several military campaigns by government forces.

Al-Qaeda militants have allied with Sunni tribesmen in southern Yemen to halt the advance of Shiite Huthi militias who seized Sanaa in September unopposed, and who have since extended their control to coastal areas and regions south of the capital.

"US, S.African Qaeda hostages killed in Yemen rescue bid","An American and a South African were killed Saturday as US forces tried to free them from Al-Qaeda in Yemen, with President Barack Obama accusing the militants of ""barbaric murder"".

Obama said he had authorised the joint attempt involving US special forces to rescue American photojournalist Luke Somers because his life was believed to be ""in imminent danger"".

South African teacher Pierre Korkie was also killed in the raid, which came just a day before he was due to be freed after more than a year in captivity, according to a charity that had been negotiating his release.

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had on Thursday threatened to execute Somers, 33, who was kidnapped more than a year ago in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, within three days if Washington failed to meet unspecified demands.

""The callous disregard for Luke's life is more proof of the depths of AQAP's depravity, and further reason why the world must never cease in seeking to defeat their evil ideology,"" Obama said in a statement.

Korkie was seized by Al-Qaeda in May 2013 in the city of Taez. He had worked as a teacher in Yemen for four years with his wife Yolande, who was freed in January following mediation by a charity.

Ten militants were killed in the joint operation in Shabwa province in southeast Yemen, Yemen's defence ministry said.

A tribal leader said soldiers were seen parachuting into the area and residents reported heavy clashes.

The mission ""was extremely well executed"", US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said during a visit to Kabul.

""It was extremely dangerous and complicated,"" he added. ""Like always with these operations, there is risk.""

""Luke was a photojournalist who sought through his images to convey the lives of Yemenis to the outside world,"" Obama added.

""He came to Yemen in peace and was held against his will and threatened by a despicable terrorist organisation.""

Somers's brother Jordan recently described him as a ""good person"", and said he did not know why he was taken hostage.

""He's a good person and he's only been trying to do good things for the Yemeni population,"" Jordan said in a video earlier this week with his mother Paula.

Details of the operation were limited, but a tribal leader said soldiers parachuted into the area in the southeastern province of Shabwa.

Residents reported heavy clashes, and Yemen said 10 militants were killed and four of its own men wounded.

- Qaeda 'murdered hostages' -

US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said both hostages were ""murdered by the AQAP terrorists during the course of the operation,"" which he described as ""extremely complicated.""

Imtiaz Sooliman, head of the charity, said US forces intervened to prevent Al-Qaeda from decapitating an American hostage.

He said he had spoken to his representative in Yemen on Friday about information Al-Qaeda planned to execute a US hostage.

""I said, that is my greatest fear... and that before they do it, American troops are going to attack and Pierre is going to die in the operation.""

He said the Americans were probably under pressure from the families of the hostages to act.

""No one can be blamed for that; it is a hostage-taking, a crisis situation and each one works for his interests,"" he said.

A State Department official said ""we assessed that there were two hostages at this location,"" including Somers. ""We did not know who the second hostage was.""

"Al-Qaeda kills hostages as US tries dramatic rescue bid","Al-Qaeda militants in Yemen killed two hostages -- an American and a South African -- during a pre-dawn gunfight as US special forces came agonisingly near to springing them free during a rescue attempt.

American photojournalist Luke Somers and South African teacher Pierre Korkie were both shot but still alive as commandoes tried to rush them to safety, and later died of their wounds, US officials said.

US President Barack Obama accused the jihadists of ""barbaric murder"", after authorising the operation following the release of an Al-Qaeda video in which Somers pleaded for his life.

A grab taken from a propaganda video released by al-Malahem Media on December 4, 2014 purportedly shows US hostage Luke Somers, 33, kidnapped more than a year ago in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, saying that his life is in danger

Vice President Joe Biden said US intelligence had worked ""relentlessly"" to free Somers and bemoaned: ""We came so close.""

One of the hostages -- it was not clear who -- died en route to a naval ship off Yemen, the USS Makin Island, and the other on the operating table aboard the vessel, officials said.

The US commandoes dropped by helicopter in the dead of night 10 kilometres (six miles) from where Somers and Korkie were being held in the southeastern Yemeni province of Shabwa.

They made their way to the Al-Qaeda hideout by foot, but were discovered about 100 metres (yards) away.

A short but intense firefight -- lasting five to 10 minutes -- erupted, a senior US defence official said. At least five militants were believed killed during the firefight, and there were no casualties among the US personnel.

""When the element of surprise was lost, and a firefight ensued, we believe that is when (the hostages) were shot,"" the official, who was with US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in the Afghan capital Kabul, said.

- 'Despicable terrorist organisation' -

Korkie's death came just a day before the 57-year-old was to be freed after more than a year in captivity, according to the charity that had negotiated his release.

British-born Somers, 33, had worked as a freelance photographer for the BBC and spent time at local newspapers, including the Yemen Times, before he was snatched off Sanaa's streets in September 2013.

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had threatened in a video Thursday to execute Somers and gave Washington three days to meet unspecified demands.

AQAP's threat followed the murder since August of five Western hostages by the Islamic State jihadist group, which controls parts of Syria and Iraq.

The senior US defence official said there were ""good indications"" AQAP had moved the deadline up and ""were preparing to kill him... which is why we moved as fast as we could"".

""It was either act now and take the risk, or let that deadline pass. And no one was willing to do that.""

Obama said that since Somers was abducted, Washington had been using ""every tool at our disposal"" to try to secure his release.

""Luke was a photojournalist who sought through his images to convey the lives of Yemenis to the outside world,"" the president added.

""He came to Yemen in peace and was held against his will and threatened by a despicable terrorist organisation.

""The callous disregard for Luke's life is more proof of the depths of AQAP's depravity.""

- 'Home for Christmas' -

In May 2013, Al-Qaeda seized Korkie and his wife Yolande, who was released in January. The couple had worked as teachers in Yemen for four years.

The Gift of Givers charity said logistical arrangements had already been put in place to fly Korkie out of Yemen on Sunday.

""The psychological and emotional devastation to Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was to be released by Al-Qaeda tomorrow,"" it said on Saturday.

""Three days ago we told her 'Pierre will be home for Christmas'. We certainly did not mean it in the manner it has unfolded.""

Imtiaz Sooliman, head of the charity, said he had anticipated on Friday that the Americans, under family pressure after the AQAP video emerged, were going to act and that he feared Korkie would die in the operation.

""No one can be blamed for that; it is a hostage-taking, a crisis situation and each one works for his interests,"" he said.

A US State Department official said ""we assessed that there were two hostages at this location"", including Somers. ""We did not know who the second hostage was.""

The United States has said American and Yemeni forces already tried unsuccessfully to rescue Somers last month.

Chuck Hagel said Luke Somers, an American citizen, was shot by his captors during the raid on Friday night, which was the second attempt by the US to rescue him.

Mr Somers, 33, was taken hostage in the Yemeni capital Sana'a more than a year ago by the extremist Islamic group, which last week released a video threatening to kill him if its demands were not met by the US authorities.

"'Barbaric' hostage murder condemned","The US and UK have both condemned the ""barbaric"" murder of a British-born photojournalist by terrorists during a failed rescue attempt in Yemen.

American citizen Luke Somers, 33, who was held hostage for more than a year by al Qaida, was killed last night by his captors during the second rescue attempt by the US military last night.

US president Barack Obama said he had sanctioned the night-time operation in Yemen's southern Shabwa state because the reporter was in ""imminent danger"".

On Thursday, a video featuring Mr Somers, who was captured in the capital Sana'a in September last year, was released by the group al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) who threatened to kill their hostage if the US authorities did not meet their demands in three days.

In a statement, the US president said: ""The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of Luke Somers at the hands of al Qaida terrorists during a rescue operation conducted by US forces in Yemen in partnership with the Yemeni government.

""On behalf of the American people, I offer my deepest condolences to Luke's family and to his loved ones.""

Mr Obama added that information ""indicated that Luke's life was in imminent danger"".

""Based on this assessment, and as soon as there was reliable intelligence and an operational plan, I authorised a rescue attempt.""

Mr Somers' sister Lucy said the family were informed of his death by the FBI this morning.

Lucy Somers told the Associated Press: ""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace.""

A second hostage was also killed in the mission, named by aid charity Gift of Givers as South African teacher Pierre Korkie.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he ""salutes"" the forces involved in the mission and offered his condolences to the families of both men.

""My deepest condolences are with the families of both hostages at this time,"" he said.

""We utterly condemn AQAP for the brutal murder of these two men.

""Luke had close links with the UK and his family have spoken about Luke's life and his work, and that is how he should be remembered.

""I salute the forces involved, who showed great courage in carrying out this mission.

""We continue to work with our international and Yemeni partners to counter the threat from al Qaida and other terrorist groups.""

A senior Obama administration official told the Associated Press that militants tried to kill Mr Somers just before the raid, wounding him.

US commandos then flew Mr Somers to a Navy ship in the region where he died.

On Thursday, the Pentagon confirmed that last month the US military had sought to rescue Mr Somers, but that he had not been found.

On the same day, AQAP issued a video on Thursday threatening to kill the hostage within three days if its demands were not met by the US authorities.

It began with a reading in Arabic from Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, an AQAP official, before Mr Somers gave a statement in English.

He said: ""My name is Luke Somers. I'm 33 years old. I was born in England, but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life.

""It's now been well over a year since I've been kidnapped in Sana'a. Basically, I'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I'm certain that my life is in danger.

""So as I sit here now, I ask if anything can be done, please let it be done. Thank you very much.""

The three-minute video also features Mr Ansi speaking about American activity in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq as well as recent air strikes in Syria.

The family of Mr Somers, who was captured in September 2013, had earlier pleaded for him to be released.

In an online video, his sister Lucy Somers described her older brother as a romantic who ""always believes the best in people."" She added: ""Please let him live.""

His father Michael said Mr Somers was ""a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people"".

The SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors Jihadist groups, reported that Yemeni jihadists said on Twitter that they had ""anticipated"" the attack.

It follows similar videos by another extremist militant group, Islamic State (IS), which has already killed two British hostages and three American hostages in videos released on social media.

IS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning.

Footage claiming to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq.

"U.S., South African hostages in Yemen killed in rescue attempt","By Mohammed Ghobari and Mohammed Mukhashaf

SANAA/ADEN, Dec 6 (Reuters) - A U.S. journalist and a South African teacher held by al Qaeda militants in Yemen were killed alongside 10 of their captors during a rescue attempt by U.S. and Yemeni forces in a remote desert village, officials said on Saturday.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and a Yemeni intelligence official said Luke Somers, 33, and Pierre Korkie were shot by their kidnappers shortly after the dawn raid began in the arid Wadi Abadan district of Shabwa, a province in southern Yemen long seen as one of al Qaeda's most formidable strongholds.

Kerry said the attempted rescue, the second attempt to free Somers in 10 days, had only been approved because of information that the American's life was in imminent danger.

However, the Gift of the Givers relief group, who were trying to secure Korkie's release, said it had negotiated for the South African teacher to be freed and had expected that to happen on Sunday and for him to be returned to his family.

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is seen by Washington as one of the movement's most dangerous branches. The United States has worked with the Yemeni government and via drone strikes to attack its leadership in southern and eastern parts of Yemen.

""The callous disregard for Luke's life is more proof of the depths of AQAP's depravity, and further reason why the world must never cease in seeking to defeat their evil ideology,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement.

He said he had authorised the attempted rescue and said the United States would ""spare no effort to use all of its military, intelligence and diplomatic capabilities to bring Americans home safely, wherever they are located"".

Somers was moved from the scene of the rescue attempt but died later from his wounds, a senior official in the Yemeni president's office said.

Gift of the Givers said in a statement on its website: ""We received with sadness the news that Pierre was killed in an attempt by American Special Forces, in the early hours of this morning, to free hostages in Yemen.""

It added: ""The psychological and emotional devastation to (Korkie's wife) Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was to be released by al Qaeda tomorrow ... Three days ago we told her 'Pierre will be home for Christmas'.""

A South African government spokesman declined to comment.

There was no new information about three other hostages, a Briton, a Turk and a Yemeni, who had previously been held alongside Somers and Korkie, a Yemeni security official told Reuters.

Lucy Somers, the photojournalist's sister, told the Associated Press that she and her father learned of her brother's death from FBI agents at 0500 GMT (12 a.m. EST) Saturday.

""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" she said from London.

IMMEDIATE DANGER

Kerry and U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel both said the decision to mount the raid was based on fears that AQAP planned to kill Somers.

""Earlier this week, AQAP released a video announcing that Luke would be murdered within 72 hours. Along with other information, there was a compelling indication that Luke's life was in immediate danger,"" Kerry said.

Hagel, in Kabul, said: ""There were compelling reasons to believe Mr Somers' life was in immediate danger."" He said Somers and another hostage, who he did not name, had been killed by al Qaeda militants.

U.S. officials on Thursday said American forces had already attempted to rescue Somers, without giving details. Yemeni officials had previously disclosed the release of six Yemenis, a Saudi and an Ethiopian hostage in a raid on Nov. 25.

The operation involved an air strike followed by a raid by U.S. and Yemeni forces, a local security official said. It took place in Dafaar village in Shabwa Province and targeted an al Qaeda group headed by Mubarak al-Harad.

""It's a very small village with only 20-40 houses. There were very quick clashes with the gunmen and then it was all finished,"" a tribal source from the area told Reuters.

A senior Yemeni intelligence official said: ""When the forces entered the place where the hostages were being held, they called on the kidnappers to give themselves up because they were surrounded on all sides.

""But the kidnappers immediately killed two hostages, which prompted the forces to open fire on the kidnappers. They tried to give first aid to the hostages but they had lost their lives.""

AQAP on Thursday released a video showing a man it said was Somers saying: ""I'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I'm certain that my life is in danger"". Reuters was not able to independently verify the authenticity of that video, which was reported on by SITE Monitoring.

"U.S., South African hostages killed in rescue attempt in Yemen","By Mohammed Ghobari and Mohammed Mukhashaf

SANAA/ADEN, Dec 6 (Reuters) - A U.S. journalist and a South African teacher held by al Qaeda militants in Yemen were killed along with some of their captors during a night rescue attempt by U.S. and Yemeni forces in a remote desert village, officials said on Saturday.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and a Yemeni intelligence official said Luke Somers, 33, and South African Pierre Korkie were shot by their kidnappers shortly after the raid began in the arid Wadi Abadan district of Shabwa, a province in southern Yemen long seen as one of al Qaeda's most formidable strongholds.

U.S. officials on Thursday said American forces had already attempted to rescue Somers, without giving details. Yemeni officials had previously disclosed the release of six Yemenis, a Saudi and an Ethiopian hostage in a raid on Nov. 25.

There were contradictory accounts of how Saturday's raid unfolded and how many of the kidnappers were killed. A Yemeni official said on Saturday morning that 10 al Qaeda suspects had died in the raid.

A U.S. official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said American special forces had conducted the operation alone at 1 a.m. in Yemen, but that the kidnappers had been alerted to their approach shortly before they arrived.

The official said the kidnappers then ""executed"" the hostages, who each sustained multiple gunshot wounds. One died during the flight out and another aboard a U.S. ship.

At no point was there an exchange of fire in the part of the compound where the hostages were being held, the source said, and at no point did U.S. forces shoot into that part of the building.

A senior U.S. official said Yemen's President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi had given his support for the operation.

Although the United States knew there were two hostages at the location, and that one of them was Somers, it did not know that the other was Korkie, the senior Washington official said.

The rescue team was made up of about 40 members of Special Operations forces, and the raid lasted about 30 minutes from start to finish, said the U.S. officials.

Yemen's government said in a statement carried on state media that its security forces had led the raid. It said the security forces had surrounded the house and called on the kidnappers to surrender, but they instead shot the hostages.

That led to an assault on the building in which four Yemeni security officers were also wounded, it said. The statement said the house belonged to suspected militant Saeed al-Daghaari, which another Yemeni security source told Reuters it was in the village of Dafaar in the Wadi Abadan district of Shabwa.

""It's a very small village with only 20-40 houses. There were very quick clashes with the gunmen and then it was all finished,"" a tribal source from the area said.

AQAP on Thursday released a video showing a man it said was Somers saying: ""I'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I'm certain that my life is in danger"". Reuters was not able to independently verify the authenticity of that video, which was reported on by SITE Monitoring.

"American, South African hostages die in rescue attempt in Yemen","By Mohammed Ghobari and Mohammed Mukhashaf

SANAA/ADEN, Dec 6 (Reuters) - U.S. special forces stormed a walled compound in a remote Yemeni village early on Saturday in an attempt to free western hostages held by an al Qaeda unit, but an American journalist and a South African teacher were killed by their captors, officials said.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and a Yemeni intelligence official said Luke Somers, 33, and South African Pierre Korkie, 56, were shot by their kidnappers shortly after the raid began in the arid Wadi Abadan district of Shabwa, a province long seen as one of al Qaeda's most formidable strongholds.

It was the second U.S. attempt to free Somers in 10 days and Kerry said it had been approved because of information that Somers' life was in imminent danger. ""It was our assessment that that clock would run out on Saturday,"" one U.S. official said.

However, the Gift of the Givers relief group, which was trying to secure Korkie's release, said it had negotiated for the teacher to be freed and had expected that to happen on Sunday and for him to be returned to his family.

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is seen by Washington as one of al Qaeda's most dangerous branches. The United States has worked with Yemen's government and via drone strikes to attack its leaders in southern and eastern Yemen.

""The callous disregard for Luke's life is more proof of the depths of AQAP's depravity, and further reason why the world must never cease in seeking to defeat their evil ideology,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement.

Obama said he had authorised the operation and said the United States would ""spare no effort to use all of its military, intelligence and diplomatic capabilities to bring Americans home safely, wherever they are located.""

SHOOT-OUT

A U.S. defense official said about 40 U.S. Special Forces troops, flown in by tilt-rotor CV-22 Osprey aircraft, had advanced to within 100 meters (yards) of the walled compound where the hostages were held before the defenders were alerted and a firefight started.

U.S. officials said they knew Somers was at the location, partly because of information they gleaned during the earlier rescue attempt, and they were aware that a second hostage was there but did not know in advance who it was.

The men were each shot several times by at least one of their retreating guards, and not in crossfire, said the officials, who declined to be identified. The men were treated by medics but one died during the flight out and another aboard a U.S. ship. More than five militants were killed and no U.S. troops were hurt, they said.

The raid lasted about 30 minutes.

Gift of the Givers said on its website: ""We received with sadness the news that Pierre was killed in an attempt by American Special Forces, in the early hours of this morning, to free hostages in Yemen.""

It added: ""The psychological and emotional devastation to (Korkie's wife) Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was to be released by al Qaeda tomorrow ... Three days ago we told her 'Pierre will be home for Christmas'.""

Yolande, who was kidnapped with her husband in mid-2013, was released in January after intervention by Gift of the Givers.

A South African government spokesman declined to comment.

There was no new information about three other hostages, a Briton, a Turk and a Yemeni, who had previously been held alongside Somers and Korkie, a Yemeni security official said.

Lucy Somers, the photojournalist's sister, told the Associated Press that she and her father learned of her brother's death from FBI agents at 0500 GMT (12 a.m. EST) Saturday. ""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" she said from London.

IMMEDIATE DANGER

Kerry said the decision to mount the raid was based on fears that AQAP planned to kill Somers.

""Earlier this week, AQAP released a video announcing that Luke would be murdered within 72 hours. Along with other information, there was a compelling indication that Luke's life was in immediate danger,"" Kerry said.

U.S. officials on Thursday said American forces had already attempted to rescue Somers, without giving details. Yemeni officials had previously disclosed the release of six Yemenis, a Saudi and an Ethiopian hostage in a raid on Nov. 25.

A senior U.S. official said Yemen's President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi had given his support for Saturday's operation, which a U.S. official said took place at 1 a.m. local time.

Yemen's government issued a different account of the incident. It said in a statement carried on state media that its security forces had led the raid. It said the security forces had surrounded the house and called on the kidnappers to surrender, but they instead shot the hostages.

That led to an assault on the building in which four Yemeni security officers were also wounded, it said.

"Luke Somers Dies In Rescue Attempt, Sister Says; Yemeni Defense Ministry Says Unnamed US Hostage Freed","Update as of 04:16 a.m. EST: A senior U.S. official has told the New York Times that Luke Somers was killed in rescue attempt launched late Friday.

The official was quoted as saying that Somers was shot by his captors, and was gravely wounded by the time U.S. commandos reached him. Despite being transferred to a U.S. naval ship in the region, the offical said Somers died from his injuries.

The U.S. State Department is expected to issue more details about the raid in the coming hours, according to Al Jazeera.

Original story below

The sister of Luke Somers, the American photojournalist held captive by al-Qaeda militants in Yemen, says that he was killed in a failed rescue attempt, Saturday, according to the Associated Press.

There are conflicting reports however, with the Reuters news agency reporting that Yemen's Defense Ministry said a raid by its forces Saturday freed a U.S. hostage, who was not named.

Lucy Somers, who said that she had heard the news from FBI agents, said: ""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" according to a report from Sky News.

A joint military operation to free Somers, conducted by U.S. and Yemeni forces, was launched Saturday, according to a report from NBC News. The network added that Somers' status was unclear.

The reports come just hours after the Associated Press reported that 9 suspected al-Qaeda fighters were killed in a drone strike in Yemen.

Somers' mother and brother appeared in an video earlier this week, in which they called on his captors to “show mercy,” to him.

A video released earlier this week by Somers' captors, al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, showed a militant threatening to kill Somers unless unspecified demands were met.

There has been no official comment or confirmation of Somers' status.

"Luke Somers: British-born photojournalist 'killed by al-Qaeda after failed rescue attempt in Yemen'","There were conflicting reports about the outcome of the operation

A British-born photojournalist has reportedly been killed by al-Qaeda militants in Yemen during a failed rescue attempt by US special forces.

Luke Somers, 33, had been held hostage since being kidnapped in the capital, Sana’a, in September 2013 as he left a supermarket.

There were conflicting reports on Saturday morning about the outcome of a joint US-Yemeni operation to free him. Some said an unnamed American hostage had been rescued while others said Mr Somers was dead.

His captors had taunted his family after a previous attempt by American and Yemeni forces to free him, saying on Thursday they would execute him within three days if the US did not meet their demands.

Al-Qaeda released a video statement from Mr Somers, where he said: “I’m looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I’m certain that my life is in danger.""

Lucy Somers, his sister, told the Associated Press today that FBI agents informed her he was killed in another failed rescue mission but Washington has not confirmed the claim.

""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" she said.

She had released a video pleading with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to let him live, describing her older brother as a romantic who ""always believes the best in people"".

Mr Somers’ father, Michael, called his son ""a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people"" and asked for his safe release and his mother and brother appealed to his captors to spare him, saying he ""was only trying to do good"".

According to a statement on the website of Yemen's defence ministry, a hostage rescue attempt on Saturday morning was successful.

A drone struck a suspected AQAP hideout at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, it said, and a subsequent raid freed an unnamed US hostage and killed 10 extremists. It was unclear whether the hostage described was Mr Somers.

No further details have emerged of Saturday's operation but the Pentagon admitted on Thursday that a secret raid last month had got the wrong location.

Special forces arrived at the target location, in a remote al-Qaeda safe haven in the desert near Yemen’s border with Saudi Arabia, to find Mr Somers was not there.

The American government considers AQAP to be the world's most dangerous arm of the international terrorist organisation after linking it to several failed attacks on US soil.

Mr Somers was born in Britain and holds dual US-UK citizenship. Having spent most of his life in the United States, he worked for two years in Yemen as a freelance photojournalist, sub-editor and interpreter for English language newspapers.

American authorities rarely discuss their controversial drone strike campaign in Yemen, which are known to cause civilian casualties, legitimising violent resistance against US intervention in the country.

Al-Qaeda and Islamist militants have gained a foothold in large parts of southern and eastern Yemen, where the government is struggling to exert control outside main cities.

“He is a great man with a kind heart who really loves the Yemeni people and the country,” Mr Al Kadas said. “He was so dedicated in trying to help change Yemen's future, to do good things for the people that he didn't leave the country his entire time here.""

According to a statement initially released on the website of Yemen's defence ministry, a hostage rescue attempt on Saturday morning was successful.

A drone struck a suspected AQAP hideout at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, it said, and a subsequent raid freed an unnamed US hostage and killed 10 extremists.

It is believed the inconsistency arose because Mr Somers did not die until after he was pulled out and taken into the care of American forces.

No further details have emerged of Saturday's operation but the Pentagon admitted on Thursday that a secret raid last month had got the wrong location.

Special forces arrived at the target, in a remote al-Qaeda safe haven in the desert near Yemen’s border with Saudi Arabia, to find Mr Somers was not there.

The American government considers AQAP to be the world's most dangerous arm of the international terrorist organisation after linking it to several failed attacks on US soil.

Mr Somers was born in Britain and holds dual US-UK citizenship. Having spent most of his life in the United States, he worked for two years in Yemen as a freelance photojournalist, sub-editor and interpreter for English language newspapers.

American authorities rarely discuss their controversial drone strike campaign in Yemen, which are known to cause civilian casualties, legitimising violent resistance against US intervention in the country.

Al-Qaeda and Islamist militants have gained a foothold in large parts of southern and eastern Yemen, where the government is struggling to exert control outside main cities.

"U.S. Hostage Luke Somers Killed During Yemen Rescue Bid: Family","American photojournalist Luke Somers, held hostage by al Qaeda in Yemen, was killed Saturday in a failed rescue attempt, his sister said. There was no immediate comment from Washington about operation, which Yemeni officials said was conducted jointly by the U.S. and Yemen.

The British-born hostage's sister, Lucy, told NBC News' partner ITV News and The Associated Press that the FBI had inform the family of the 33-year-old's death.

The operation took place in Shabwa province, a Yemen interior ministry official told NBC News, adding that 10 militants were also killed. It came two days after the Pentagon acknowledged an earlier U.S. commando mission to rescue Somers had failed. Teacher and photographer Somers, a British-born U.S. citizen, was abducted a year ago in Sanaa where he had been working as a freelance photographer for the Yemen Times.

Al Qaeda posted a video Thursday that showed Somers and a local militant commander threatening that thwe hostage would meet his fate in three days if the U.S. didn't meet the group's demands.

"Luke Somers, American Hostage, Is Killed During Rescue Attempt in Yemen, U.S. Official Says","SANA, Yemen — An American journalist held for more than a year by Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen was killed during a rescue attempt by United States commandos late Friday, a senior United States official said.

Early reports of the overnight raid were sketchy. The official said that the journalist, Luke Somers, 33, was apparently shot by his captors as the raid unfolded and was badly wounded when the commandos reached him. By the time Mr. Somers was flown to a United States naval ship in the region, he had died from his injuries, the official said Saturday.

There was no immediate comment from the Obama administration about the raid, which took place in the southern Yemeni province of Shabwa. When asked about the operation at a security conference in Bahrain, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, the head of United States Central Command, declined to comment.

"Luke Somers, American Hostage, Is Killed During Rescue Attempt in Yemen","SANA, Yemen — Two hostages, including an American journalist, who were being held by Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen were killed during a rescue attempt by United States commandos early Saturday, American officials said.

In a statement, President Obama said the hostages had been “murdered” by militants belonging to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula during the rescue operation. A senior United States official said that the American, Luke Somers, 33, was badly wounded when commandos reached him. By the time Mr. Somers was flown to a United States naval ship in the region, he had died from his injuries, the official said Saturday.

The other hostage was identified as Pierre Korkie, a South African citizen, according to a brief statement posted on the website of Gift of the Givers, a disaster relief organization that was trying to negotiate his release.

A Yemeni tribal leader who said he was a witness to the raid, in the southern province of Shabwa, said that two Al Qaeda militants and at least eight civilians were killed during firefights as U.S. commandos raided several homes.

Mr. Obama said in his statement, “It is my highest responsibility to do everything possible to protect American citizens. As this and previous hostage rescue operations demonstrate, the United States will spare no effort to use all of its military, intelligence and diplomatic capabilities to bring Americans home safely, wherever they are located.”

It was the second failed attempt to rescue Mr. Somers, a freelance photographer who was abducted from a street in the Yemeni capital in September 2013. Last month, United States commandos and Yemeni counterterrorism troops mounted a raid on a remote cave in Yemen near the border with Saudi Arabia, freeing eight other hostages but failing to locate Mr. Somers.

On Wednesday, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemeni extremist group that was holding Mr. Somers, threatened to kill him by the end of the week if its demands were not met. In the video, a leader of the group spoke of the November raid and warned the United States not to carry out any similar operations.

Mr. Somers’ family broke its silence after the video appeared, urging his captors to release him in a video of their own and insisting that they had no prior knowledge of the first rescue attempt. “Luke is only a photojournalist, and he is not responsible for any actions the U.S. government has taken,” said his brother, Jordan Somers.

There was no immediate word on the fate of at least two other hostages who were believed to have been held with Mr. Somers, including citizens of Britain and Turkey.

The tribal leader who said he witnessed the raid, Tarek al-Daghari al-Awlaki, said helicopters and as many as a hundred troops descended on the village, Wadi Abadan. The U.S. forces deployed concussion grenades as they raided four houses in the village, he said.

“The shooting caused panic,” Mr. Daghari said. “Nine of the dead are from my tribe. Two of the dead are known to be members of Al Qaeda.” He said that two wounded civilians, a woman and a child, were taken to a nearby hospital.","1"
"Luke Somers 'killed in failed rescue attempt in Yemen'","The sister of British-born American photojournalist Luke Somers has said he has been killed in a failed rescue attempt in Yemen.

Lucy Somers told The Associated Press on Saturday that she learned of her 33-year-old brother's death from FBI agents. There was no immediate comment from Washington.

Lucy Somers said: ""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace.""

However, Yemen's defence ministry released a statement claiming that armed forces early on Saturday freed ""an American hostage"" being held by al-Qaeda and killed 10 members of the militant group holding him, Reuters reported.

Luke Somers was abducted in September 2013 in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. This week, the Pentagon confirmed it launched an earlier failed raid to rescue him.

Somers' reported death comes as a Yemeni security official said a suspected US drone strike at dawn Saturday killed nine alleged al-Qaeda militants in the country's southern Shabwa province.

Tribal leaders said they saw helicopters flying nearby after the strike.

"Luke Somers' sister says he was killed in failed Yemen rescue attempt","American photojournalist Luke Somers, held by al-Qaeda militants following his abduction in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in September last year, was killed during a failed rescue attempt early Saturday, according to his sister.

Lucy Somers said she learned of her brother's death from the FBI. ""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" she said. Lucy Somers gave the comments to the Associated Press.

The claim nonetheless seemed to contradict a statement on the Yemen defense ministry's website carried by Reuters that suggested Luke Somers had been freed following a suspected U.S. drone strike Saturday in Yemen that killed nine alleged al-Qaeda militants.

The drone struck at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, hitting a suspected militant hideout, according to an official who spoke to the AP. The official did not elaborate and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to brief journalists.

There was also no immediate comment from U.S. officials, who rarely discuss their drone campaign in Yemen.

Following the strike, the Al Arabiya news organization tweeted that ""reports suggest U.S. #journalists held in #Yemen freed,"" but there was no immediate confirmation of that report or the originating source.

In a YouTube video released Wednesday, Somers, 33, says is certain his ""life is in danger.""

The video features an al-Qaeda official and a brief message from Somers — dressed in a purple shirt and with a shaved head — at the end. He notes that he was born in England but has American citizenship and lived in America for most of his life.

"Hewlett-Packard Announces Plans To Break Up Company","Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ +6.68%  on Monday said it plans to separate its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, the latest attempt by the technology company to improve its fortunes by breaking itself in two.

The company will make the split through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders by the end of fiscal 2015.

If the division goes off as planned, it would give rise to two publicly traded companies, each with more than $50 billion in annual revenue.

H-P also boosted the number of its expected layoffs by 5,000 to 55,000, after identifying “incremental opportunities for reductions.” H-P had previously projected its job cuts to be between 45,000 and 50,000, and it has already shed 36,000 employees under the restructuring program as of the end of the most recent quarter.

A number of big companies, including eBay Inc. EBAY -0.77%  in tech, have chosen to break up lately, in part because of a belief that operations with different growth profiles are best managed as separate entities. H-P, which has suffered sharp sales declines, sees better long-term potential for its corporate hardware and services business than for its printer and PC unit, said one person familiar with the plan.

The impending move, first reported Sunday by The Wall Street Journal, set off a round of speculation in the industry about whether the separation could lead to more deal making.

The Journal recently reported that for much of the past year, H-P held talks to merge with data-storage equipment maker EMC Corp. EMC +0.49%  , a deal that would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion. Although the talks recently ended, the separation could pave the way for H-P’s corporate hardware and services business to ultimately be combined with EMC, industry observers said.

The planned breakup is one that Palo Alto, Calif.-based H-P and its investors have long contemplated. H-P came close to hiving off its PC operation in 2011, when it announced the ill-fated acquisition of U.K. software company Autonomy Corp. H-P said then it was exploring a separation of its PC business, only to decide two months later to hold on to it amid pressure from shareholders, which led to the departure of then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker.

H-P in 1999 spun off Agilent Technologies, A +1.93%  a maker of electronic-testing gear and other hardware. Agilent subsequently announced plans to break itself up.


H-P chief Meg Whitman is slated to be chairman of a PC and printer business, while remaining CEO of a separate company selling corporate hardware and services. Associated Press
In 2012, under current H-P Chief Executive Meg Whitman, the company reorganized itself to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation, helping pave the way for the current plan.

Ms. Whitman is slated to be chairman of the PC and printer business, to be known as HP Inc., and CEO of the other company, to be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Current lead independent director Pat Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company, while Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO of that business.

H-P, which affirmed its guidance for the year ending Oct. 31, said it expects per-share earnings of $3.83 to $4.03 for fiscal 2015. The range doesn’t include one-time charges expected to be connected to the separation. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were projecting $3.95 a share.

In the 2013 fiscal year ended last October, the Printing and Personal Systems Group, as it is known, reported $55.9 billion in revenue, about half of H-P’s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for company revenue as a whole.

Last year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China’s Lenovo Group Ltd 0992.HK +0.68%  , according to industry research firm IDC.

H-P’s shares have risen sharply since the beginning of last year, but they remain well below their highs in recent years—and the even loftier levels they reached during the 1990s tech boom. H-P shares increased 2% on Friday to $35.20, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion.

In response to lower sales and to provide a lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.

Ms. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as “cloud” software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.

The recent wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world has been fueled by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well-received by shareholders—and sometimes actively sought by them.

Last Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay, where Ms. Whitman was once CEO, announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBay’s decision, pushing the company’s shares up about 7.5% that day.

"Report: HP to split into two companies, one focused on PCs/printers and one on enterprise computing","Hewlett Packard plans to split into two companies on Monday, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. One company will be focused on enterprise computing and services, and the other will build and sell PCs and printers.

Current HP CEO Meg Whitman will lead the enterprise-focused version of HP (it’s not clear who gets to keep the iconic name) and will be chairman of the PC/printer company, which will be led by Dion Weisler as CEO. Details are still fuzzy as to how this will all work, but WSJ reported that HP plans to announce the move on Monday.

HP is perhaps the seminal Silicon Valley company, with a rich history of computing breakthroughs and technology leadership since it was founded in 1939. But despite taking in $112 billion in revenue in 2013 (split almost evenly between the groups that will form the two separate companies) it has struggled over the last decade with the decline of the PC market, the rise of mobile computing, and the shift to enterprise cloud computing. A series of at-times comical leadership fiascos hasn’t helped.

I’ll update this post as more information becomes available, and we’ll certainly cover any announcement HP might make tomorrow.","1"
"HP is better not together — company to split into enterprise and PC/printer businesses","Hewlett-Packard is now forging ahead with plans to split off its PC-and-printer businesses into a separate company, with the rest of the company’s enterprise portfolio staying together in a separate entity to be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, the company said early Monday morning.

The Hewlett-Packard enterprise unit, comprising servers, storage, networking, converged systems, services and software and the OpenStack Helion cloud, will be led by Meg Whitman as president and CEO. Pat Russo will be chairman of that board.

The PC and printer entity, to be known as HP Inc., will be led by Dion Weisler as president and CEO, with Whitman as chairman. The Wall Street Journal (registration required) was first to report this news Sunday afternoon.

“Our work during the past three years has significantly strengthened our core businesses to the point where we can more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,” Whitman said in a statement. “The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan. It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders.”

HP, truly an iconic IT company, has been slammed in the past decade by the shift to mobile devices and cloud and a series of management fiascos including the short-lived tenure of former CEO Leo Apotheker. Under his watch, the company considered selling off its still huge PC business, a plan that was scotched by Whitman when she took the reins in 2011. The rationale behind holding onto the PC business was that it gave HP huge volume buying power advantages in procuring chips and other components for its server business as well.

Toni Sacconaghi, senior analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in a note that while a split up of HP is hardly a new topic, his take is that the spin off  seems to be “fueled by weakness at HP rather than strength.” He also noted that HP in the past few months “came close” to buying Rackspace for nearly $6 billion; nearly bought EMC and “apparently has shopped various parts of its portfolio PCs, its Unix business, IT Services.”

In another research report released before the news was official, Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um wrote:

We believe a separation may suggest HP could become more active in both divestitures and acquisitions, which we believed would be increasingly necessary in FY2015. While this is somewhat of an about face from its prior stance that it was “better together”, we believe this, if true, is likely to be driven by competitive market dynamics as well as a stabilization in its PC business.
The separation, which HP said will be tax-free to shareholders in terms of federal income taxes, is slated to be done by the end of HP’s 2015 fiscal year, ending October 31, 2015.

"Hewlett-Packard will reportedly split into two companies","The legendary Hewlett-Packard reportedly is about to become two companies.

One will focus on the firm’s personal computer and printer business, and the other on its business hardware and services, according to a story in today’s Wall Street Journal.

The publication, citing “people familiar with the matter,” said the split may be made public as early as tomorrow.

The Journal said that current CEO Meg Whitman will become CEO of the enterprise-oriented company, and independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman. Whitman will serve as chairman of the PC/printer firm, and exec Dion Weisler will be CEO.

HP has been struggling with its dual selves of being oriented toward businesses’ high-end needs and toward personal computers and printers. Various company executives have in the past discussed spinning off its PC unit, only to be followed by the company asserting its long-term interest in PCs.

In 2000, Agilent Technologies split off from HP, taking with it the test and measurement equipment business that was HP’s first line of business.

The company had long reigned as the top PC maker in the world, although it dropped to second place last year in the rankings of industry research firm IDC, after Lenovo. Its printer/personal systems group rakes in about $56 billion in fiscal 2013, about half the company’s total, but sales are down about seven percent from the previous year.

"Hewlett-Packard to split into two companies","Technology giant Hewlett-Packard, known as HP, is to split itself into two separate companies.

The US firm will separate its better-performing computer and printer business from its corporate hardware and services operations.

Shareholders will be given a stake in both businesses.

The split is part of a radical restructuring plan, which has already resulted in tens of thousands of job cuts in recent years.

The firm is now in the fourth year of its five-year turnaround plan, aimed at helping the firm adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing.

Current chief executive Meg Whitman, who has the job of reviving the fortunes of the 75-year-old firm, will head the new spin-off, Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

This will house the corporate hardware and services operations.

She will also be chairman of HP's printing and PC business, HP Inc, which last quarter accounted for about half its revenue and profit.

Ms Whitman said the split would give both firms the ""flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics"".

""We can [now] more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,"" she added.

HP said it expected the division to be complete by the end of the 2015 financial year.

Business pressures

The division of HP's businesses comes at a time when other large tech firms are being urged to break up.

Last week, online auction site eBay announced it was splitting off its payments system PayPal into a separate company.

HP has been under pressure from newer rivals such as Chinese firm Lenovo, which overtook HP as the world's largest PC maker in 2012. Third-ranked US rival Dell was taken private last year.

Today's announcement comes as HP approaches the fourth year of its five-year turnaround plan. Over this time, the company has executed successfully against its turnaround objectives, keeping customers and partners at the forefront. HP has reignited its innovation pipeline, strengthened its go-to-market capabilities, rebuilt its balance sheet, and inspired its workforce and management teams. The company is now positioned to accelerate performance, drive sustained growth and demonstrate clear industry leadership in key areas.

""Our work during the past three years has significantly strengthened our core businesses to the point where we can more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,"" said Meg Whitman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of HP. ""The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan. It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders. In short, by transitioning now from one HP to two new companies, created out of our successful turnaround efforts, we will be in an even better position to compete in the market, support our customers and partners, and deliver maximum value to our shareholders.""

Both companies will be well capitalized and expect to have investment grade credit ratings and capital structures optimized to reflect their distinct growth opportunities and cash flow profiles. The separation into independent publicly traded companies will provide each company with its own, more focused equity currency, and investors with the opportunity to invest in two companies with compelling and unique financial profiles well suited to their respective businesses.

Management StructureMeg Whitman, President and Chief Executive Officer of HP, and Cathie Lesjak, Chief Financial Officer of HP, will hold these positions with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. When the separation is complete, Whitman will also serve on the Board of Directors of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and Pat Russo will move from Lead Independent Director of HP to Chairman of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.

Dion Weisler, Executive Vice President of HP's Printing and Personal Systems business, will lead HP Inc. as President and Chief Executive Officer. Whitman will serve as non-executive Chairman of HP Inc.'s Board of Directors.

Hewlett-Packard EnterpriseHewlett-Packard Enterprise will have a unique portfolio and strong multi-year innovation roadmap across technology infrastructure, software and services to allow customers to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by cloud, big data, security and mobility in the New Style of IT. By leveraging its HP Financial Services capability, the company will be well positioned to create unique technology deployment models for customers and partners based on their specific business needs. Additionally, the company intends for HP Financial Services to continue to provide financing and business model innovation for customers and partners of HP Inc.

Customers will have the same unmatched choice of how to deploy and consume technology, and with a simpler, more nimble partner. The separation will provide additional resources, and a reduction of debt at the operating company level, to support investments across key areas of the portfolio. The separation will also allow for greater flexibility in completing the turnaround of Enterprise Services and strengthening the company's go-to-market capabilities.

""Over the past three years, we have reignited our innovation engine with breakthrough offerings for the enterprise like Apollo, Gen 9 and Moonshot servers, our 3PAR storage platform, our HP OneView management platform, our HP Helion Cloud and a host of software and services offerings in security, analytics and application transformation,"" continued Whitman. ""Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will accelerate innovation across key next-generation areas of the portfolio.""

HP Inc.HP Inc. will be a proven leader in the personal systems and printing markets with exciting new technologies on the horizon. The new company's strong profitability and free cash flow will enable investments in growth markets such as 3-D printing and new computing experiences. At the same time, HP Inc. will continue to execute against a well-defined and established strategic plan, ensuring continuity for customers and consistent value to shareholders.

""Since assuming responsibility for the Printing and Personal Systems Group, Dion and his leadership team have done an excellent job of building our relationships with customers and channel partners, segmenting the market and driving product innovation,"" added Whitman. ""The creation of HP Inc. will only accelerate the progress the team has made.""

""This is a defining moment in our industry as customers are looking for innovation to enable workforces that are more mobile, connected and productive while at the same time allowing a seamless experience across work and play,"" said Weisler. ""As the market leader in printing and personal systems, an independent HP Inc. will be extremely well positioned to deliver that innovation across our traditional markets as well as extend our leadership into new markets like 3-D printing and new computing experiences -- inventing technology that empowers people to create, interact and inspire like never before.""

Transaction DetailsThe separation transaction is intended to be tax-free to HP shareholders for federal income tax purposes. The transaction is currently targeted to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015, subject to certain conditions, including, among others, obtaining final approval from the HP Board of Directors, receipt of a favorable opinion and/or rulings with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction for federal income tax purposes and the effectiveness of a Form 10 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Financial OutlookFor fiscal 2014, HP reaffirms its non-GAAP diluted net EPS outlook range of $3.70 to $3.74, and updates its fiscal 2014 GAAP diluted net EPS outlook to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.64.

For fiscal 2015, HP estimates non-GAAP diluted net EPS outlook to be in the range of $3.83 to $4.03 and GAAP diluted net EPS outlook to be in the range of $3.23 to $3.43.

HP's outlook does not include one-time GAAP charges the company is expected to incur in connection with the separation, including advisory and tax costs which will be quantified at a later date.

About HPHP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society.

More information about HP is available at http://www.hp.com.

Use of non-GAAP financial informationTo supplement HP's historical and forecasted financial results presented on a GAAP basis, HP provides non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is defined to exclude the effects of any restructuring charges, charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and certain other acquisition-related charges recorded or expected to be recorded during the relevant period. In addition, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit associated with each non-GAAP item. Fiscal 2014 non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude after-tax costs of approximately $1.10 per share, related primarily to restructuring charges and amortization of intangible assets. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude after-tax costs of approximately $0.60 per share, related primarily to amortization of intangible assets and restructuring charges.

HP's management uses non-GAAP financial measures, including HP's non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, to evaluate and forecast HP's performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by HP's management to be outside of HP's core business segment operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of HP's results as reported under GAAP. For example, items such as the amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting HP's cash position, represent the loss in value of intangible assets over time. The expense associated with this loss in value is not included in HP's non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and therefore does not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of those intangible assets. In addition, items such as restructuring charges that are excluded from HP's non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on HP's GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share differently than HP does, which limits the usefulness of that measure for comparative purposes.

HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year.

Shares of the company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, rose almost 8 percent in premarket trading on Monday. (Get the latest quote here.)

The announcement on Monday confirmed a report of the split in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.

"Hewlett-Packard splits off PC, printer businesses","NEW YORK (AP) — Hewlett-Packard is splitting itself into two companies, one focused on its personal computer and printing business and another on technology services, such as data storage, servers and software, as it aims to drive profits higher.

The company laid off tens of thousands of people in recent years as sales crumbled, with customers shifting to mobile devices like smartphones and computer tablets. That has drastically curbed demand for HP's desktop and laptop computers, as well as its printers.

The company said Monday that the PC and printer business will use the name HP Inc. The services business will be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.

HP CEO Meg Whitman will lead the Enterprise business. HP PC and printer chief Dion Weisler will be CEO of HP Inc.

""The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan,"" Whitman said. ""It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics.""

The split, if approved by the company board, is expected to close by the end of fiscal 2015. Once complete, HP stockholders will own shares of both companies.

During its most recent quarter HP reported revenue of $27.6 billion, a 1 percent annual gain. It marked HP's first year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue since late 2011. Printers and computers contributed 51 percent of the company's quarterly revenue, with the rest coming from technology services like consulting, software and financial programs.

HP is expected to complete the latest round of layoffs, between 11,000 to 16,000 people, this month. That is on top of the 34,000 people it had already jettisoned from its payroll.

Another tech stalwart announced a split this month. In a bid to drive growth, eBay Inc. said it would spin off its mobile payment service PayPal into a separate and publicly traded company. Investors sent eBay shares up more than 7 percent on the day of the announcement.

HP maintained its guidance for fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings between $3.70 and $3.74 per share. Analysts polled by FactSet predict earnings of $3.73 per share.

For fiscal 2015, the company anticipates adjusted earnings in a range of $3.83 to $4.03 per share. Wall Street is looking for $3.96 per share.

Shares of Hewlett-Packard Co., based in Palo Alto, California, gained $2.85, or 8.1 percent, to $38.05 before the market open.

"Hewlett-Packard to split into two public companies, lay off 5,000","By Supantha Mukherjee and Edwin Chan

Oct 6 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations, and eliminate another 5,000 jobs as part of its turnaround plan.

HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year, the details of which still needed to be worked out.

Each business contributes about half of HP's revenue and profit.

Shares of the 75-year-old company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, were up 4 percent at $36.60 in early trading on Monday.

A spinoff of the PC business was last proposed in 2011 by then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker as the company struggled in the highly competitive PC market. HP later ditched the plan - and Apotheker, replacing him with current CEO Meg Whitman.

""Make no mistake, one HP was the right thing to do to begin the turnaround of this company,"" Whitman said on a conference call. ""But now ... this is definitely the right tactic.""

HP said it planned to cut 5,000 more jobs as part of its multi-year restructuring, raising the total under Whitman to 55,000. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.

The separation will result in a fundamental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which is on track to generate $112 billion in revenue in the fiscal year this month.

Many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the PC business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations that sell computer servers and networking gear and data storage to businesses.

""Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates,"" Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.

Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP, which has a market value of almost $70 billion.

Update: Recode also says it's aware of the split, and has an explanation for it. Supposedly, HP had no luck in early talks to sell its PC division to Dell or Lenovo. It had similar problems offloading server and services groups, and a merger with the data storage gurus at EMC also wasn't meant to be. The breakup would effectively revive plans shelved when CEO Leo Apotheker got the boot in 2011; getting rid of less successful products (in this case, PCs) would improve the chances of an EMC merger or similar deals.

Update 2: HP has now confirmed the news. In a filing with the SEC, the company states that it plans to split into two publicly traded companies. Its consumer-focused PC, tablet, and printing efforts will continue on under the HP banner, while a new company named Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will focus on ""enterprise technology infrastructure"" and ""software and services businesses."" Meg Whitman, the current CEO of HP, will take the reins at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, while Dion Weisler, the company's EVP for Printing and Personal Systems, will lead the new HP.

"Hewlett Packard ‘planning to split into two’","Employer of 300,000 will separate its computer and printer business from its corporate hardware and services operations

Hewlett-Packard is planning to split into two companies as it looks to put more focus on the faster-growing corporate services market, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The move, which could be announced on Monday, would be a monumental reshaping of one of technology’s most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112bn (£70bn) in revenue this fiscal year but has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing.

Under the reported plan, HP will separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations and spin the unit off through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year.

A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.

HP’s printing and personal computing business accounts for about half its revenue and profit, according to last quarter’s financial results. It is not clear how many of HP’s staff –about 300,000 people – work in each of the planned businesses.

Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a garage in Palo Alto, California in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the personal computer revolution. Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing and has been overshadowed by younger rivals.

HP’s market value of $66bn is dwarfed by Apple Inc’s $596bn and Microsoft Corp’s $380bn.

It has also been overtaken by aggressive Chinese computer maker Lenovo, which is now the world’s number one, based on shipments. Dell, which is HP’s closest US competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year.","1"

"HP reportedly plans to split PC and printer business from enterprise unit","HP is set to cleave itself in two, splitting off its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. According to The Wall Street Journal, an announcement could come as soon as tomorrow. ""Sources familiar with the matter"" tell the paper that current CEO Meg Whitman will become chairman of the PC and printer operation, and will remain CEO of the split-off enterprise business. Dion Weisler will become CEO of the personal computing business — he is currently a high-ranking executive in the division.

This is not the first time talk of splitting HP has surfaced. During some of the company's very tumultuous 2011, reports suggested that executives were close to making the very same decision to split off the enterprise division into its own business. After the departure of then-CEO Léo Apotheker, the company decided to keep the units together under the same corporate umbrella.

The company, based in Palo Alto, has struggled along with the rest of the PC industry as profit margins have slimmed and sales of Windows PC continue to steadily decline. The company's printer business is more lucrative than its PC operation, though the two were combined into the same unit back in 2012. That same year, HP lost the title of top-selling PC manufacturer to Lenovo.","1"
"HP announces plan to split in two","Hewlett-Packard is officially splitting in two. Following rumors over the weekend, HP is announcing today that it will separate its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. The split means current CEO Meg Whitman will become the chairman of the PC and printer operation, and continue as CEO of the split-off enterprise business. Dion Weisler, an executive at HP’s PC business, will take over as CEO of the company’s PC and printer operation.

HP Enterprise is the newly split-off part of the original company, and HP Inc will continue to focus on PCs and printers. ""The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan,"" says HP CEO Meg Whitman. ""It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders."" HP is planning to complete the split by the end of fiscal 2015, and the structure will mean the company's total planned layoffs will rise to 55,000 from an earlier estimate of 45,000 to 50,000 cuts.

Today’s split is a significant change for the company, following rumors from 2011 that HP was considering a similar split at the time. Those reports surfaced shortly before HP appointed Meg Witman as CEO, just 11 months after former CEO Leo Apotheker took over from Mark Hurd after he was forced to resign amidst charges of inappropriate business conduct. Apotheker spearheaded a disastrous acquisition of Autonomy, and failed to capitalize on the company’s purchase of webOS.

Whitman’s era at HP has seen the company struggle to cement a solid position in the industry, leaving Lenovo to dominate PC sales worldwide. Whitman’s initial assessment of the company after around six months left her feeling it was ""too complex and too slow,"" noting it had underinvested in its PC division. Instead of significant investment, Whitman claimed in 2012 that the company had to offer a smartphone, before failing to announce one in 2013. Board members reportedly mulled spinning off the company’s consumer PC business in 2013, but it never happened. HP has recently focused on Android tablets, and even an Android laptop, after describing Microsoft as an ""outright competitor.""

HP and Microsoft appear to be forming a closer relationship with the launch of new low-cost Stream PCs. Although Lenovo continues to push Windows-based PCs, Microsoft still needs close PC allies as it demonstrated with a $2 billion loan to help Dell go private last year. That particular deal may have angered HP, but the renewed partnership will see Microsoft and HP take on Chromebooks this holiday season. HP is also planning to sell a smartwatch this fall.

A new HP says it will focus on ""new computing experiences"" and technologies like 3D printing. ""As the market leader in printing and personal systems, an independent HP Inc. will be extremely well positioned to deliver that innovation across our traditional markets as well as extend our leadership into new markets like 3-D printing and new computing experiences -- inventing technology that empowers people to create, interact and inspire like never before,"" says Dion Weisler, head of HP's Printing and Personal Systems business.","1"

"Hugh Hefner Dead Rumors Not True","Sunday night Facebook went crazy with Hugh Hefner dead rumors — but RumorFix can tell you they are not true.
 
A bogus website with the url — nbctoday.co — published a story on Sunday with the headline: “Breaking: Playboy Tycoon Hugh Hefner Passes Away at Age of 88.” By the way, the official website for the Today Show is www.today.com.
hugh hefner dead rumors started by bogus website
By 9:45 p.m. Sunday night, the story was shared 130,000 times and the huge influx of traffic shutdown the site at different times during the evening.
The article looked very authentic including fake quotes from a police officer stating Hef had died Sunday morning. The last four lines from the story were directly lifted from Hugh’s Wikipedia profile.
But on Sunday evening, Hugh was very much alive he even tweeted a photo from the Playboy mansion, where it was movie night. He and wife Crystal Hefner watched American Sniper.","1"
"'Rumours of my death are greatly exaggerated': Relax ladies, Hugh Hefner is alive and kicking","Playboy boss Hugh Hefner has denied reports that he is dead and said the rumours were 'greatly exaggerated'..

There were recent rumours on the Internet that the 85-year-old had passed away after suffering a heart attack.

A story claimed Playboy magazine would be printed as usual after his death and a Playmate even spoke out about his life.

Love: Hugh Hefner with his then fiancee Crystal Harris who he broke up with just days before his wedding. he has since found a new mate

But soon after the story started to be picked up by several different news outlets, the Playboy founder took to his Twitter page to confirm he is still alive.

He wrote: 'The rumours of my death are, as Mark Twain observed in a similar situation, greatly exaggerated. I'm very much alive & kicking.'

Shera Bechard, 27, French-Canadian model and fledgling actress and now Hef's girlfriend

And to prove how much alive he was, he added: 'I'm lying in bed next to Shera with a big smile on my face, reading tweets about my unexpected demise.'

Shera Bechard is his 24-year-old girlfriend.

Many confused tweeters sent messages about his apparent demise with @WolfesMother writing: 'Weird rumour doing the rounds...Hugh Hefner has gone to the big mansion in the sky?! Prob just a rumour, cause he's immortal right?!'

Moments after his 'death' was reported, the ageing lothario's name was a trending topic on Twitter.

Hefner has not been out of the papers of late, more recently for his very public break up with his former fiancée Crystal Harris shortly before their wedding was due to take place.

Harris cites infidelity on Hefner's part, Hefner said it was the other way around. He has since rebounded with Shera Bechard.

The eternal bachelor did not seem as if he were about to die from heart break however.

He has already replaced Crystal with more than one girlfriend and he has openly spoken of his excitement about watching an upcoming programme about his wedding-that-almost was.

Girlfriends: Hef with Kendra Wilkinson, Bridget Marquardt and Holly Madison while promoting E!'s reality TV show Girls Next Door

After he confirmed that he was still alive, he wrote: 'The guys and I watched an early edit of Hef's Runaway Bride tonight. The fans are going to love it.'

Hefner launched the Playboy empire in 1953 which he financed by selling his furniture and gathering about $8000 from 25 investors.

He has been married twice and has four children. At one point, he had seven girlfriends who all lived in the Playboy mansion with him, spawning the hit E! TV series The Girls Next Door, which starred playmates Holly Madison, Kendra Wilkinson-Baskett and Bridget Marquardt.

Madison and Wilkinson-Baskett went on to star in Holly's World and Kendra, becoming minor stars of their own.

Kendra recently appeared on Dancing with the Stars.","1"
"Hugh Hefner is not dead: Playboy founder makes it to film night despite mortality rumours","A report emerged yesterday alleging the businessman has been found dead

Hugh Hefner is very much still alive, despite a hoax concerning his death.

The Playboy founder, 88, was pictured on a family film night yesterday evening. His wife Crystal Hefner shared the image, along with a quote about the importance of truth - a version of a Mark Twain quote.

A lie can run around the world before the truth has got it's boots on. #QuoteOfTheDay

A fake version of NBC called NBCToday.co published a story yesterday which stated that Hefner’s body had been found in the Playboy Mansion. It cited his cause of death of death as natural causes. The story was shared by 273,000 and liked by 77,000.

Meanwhile, the businessman was busy watching American Sniper with his family merrily enjoying the festive period.

Tonight's Mansion movie is ""American Sniper.""

So fear not world, Hefner’s dinosaur-like vision of women as dehumanised sex objects will reign on.","1"
"Hugh Hefner Found Dead But Still Makes It To Family Movie Night","Hugh Hefner was presumed to be dead of natural causes, Sunday, December 28, 2014. Well, that’s the story which was given from a fake sub-medium of NBC called NBCToday.co. This site can’t be called news satire because once “nbctoday.co” is entered as the URL address, it takes the user straight to the fake story.

Though the story is fake, it spread like wildfire, seemingly without anyone bothering to research the issue himself or herself.

As of 11 p.m. PST, the Hugh Hefner fake-death story had over 159,000 Facebook shares, along with over 39,000 Likes. Likewise, it has approximately 1800 Twitter shares. Unfortunately, by sunrise, this fake Hugh Hefner story may be trending.

The story states that police responded to Hugh Hefner’s estate on December 28 at approximately 9 a.m., where Hefner’s body was identified, and he was pronounced dead.

However, as can be seen from his wife Crystal Hefner”s Twitter update, Hugh is alive and enjoying his time with family.

Movie night with the family pic.twitter.com/65QaTvJDNL

Fortunately, the entire story is fabricated. The only other possibility is that he died and was revived. However, there is nothing on Crystal Hefner’s social media that indicates any kind of scare of such magnitude.

However, she does offer a witty quote regarding the Hugh Hefner death story.

A lie can run around the world before the truth has got it’s boots on. #QuoteOfTheDay

— Crystal Hefner (@crystalhefner) December 29, 2014

This statement, along with the “family night” photo, was made only a few hours ago. Whereas, Hugh Hefner was supposed to have been dead around 9 a.m. And unless Hugh has someone managing his social media profiles, he made his own tweets shortly before his wife.

Tonight’s Mansion movie is “American Sniper.”

— Hugh Hefner (@hughhefner) December 29, 2014

He also retweeted what his wife tweeted afterwards. So sensibly, had Hugh Hefner passed, there would be a buzzing frenzy coming from the Playmates, let alone the rest of the media world.

It would benefit many to perform a little research before taking things as they come.

@crystalhefner Dear Crystal Sorry for your loss, may God bless you and your family!

— L.S. (@UltraGator) December 29, 2014

And that comment was after Crystal stated that the story wasn’t true.

However, there is one thing the anonymous writer got right. Hugh Hefner is 88 years of age. It seems as though he doesn’t plan on letting go of life just yet.","1"
"Man breaks down in tears when a lost recording of his deceased wife resurfaces","After Stan Beaton's wife, Ruby, passed away in 2003, he saved the ""leave a message after the beep"" recording that they had shared.

The recording was lost after Virgin Mobile conducted some technical work, but with the help of BBC Radio Leeds, the company was able to retrieve the deleted message for Stan — and captured his reaction to hearing it again.

Stan, 68, is incredulous when he hears the good news. In the video, a reporter tells Stan that it took 10 people a total of three days to retrieve the message. ""That must have cost a fortune!"" Stan exclaims.

""It's just a wonderful, wonderful sound that I thought was lost forever,"" Stan says. I suppose it's going to be a bit of a PR job now, but thank you Virgin Media.""

"Mirfield man's tears of joy after lost voicemail of wife retrieved","A husband who thought he had lost a recording of his late wife's voice he had kept for more than 10 years has described the moment the message was recovered as ""wonderful"".

Stan Beaton, from Mirfield, had kept the voicemail since his wife Ruby's death in 2003, but technical work by Virgin Media meant it was deleted.

However, the telecoms company has now managed to recover the message.

Mr Beaton, 68, said: ""They've made this old age pensioner extremely happy.""

Listening to the message he said: ""It's just a wonderful, wonderful sound that I thought was lost forever.

""I'm staggered at the lengths they have gone to.""

Mr Beaton told BBC Radio Leeds the message he had kept since his wife's death from cancer was lost in December.

He said: ""I've always resisted changing companies because whenever I mentioned that my wife's voice was our voicemail message and would it be retained and each company said no, so that's why I never changed.

""Sadly it disappeared. I was absolutely devastated by it, but also extremely angry.

""In the early days [I listened to it] quite often. Basically it came to the point when if I felt low then I would listen to it.

""In December I learned that it had disappeared. I just could not tell people how it affected me at that time. It really did devastate me.""

Mr Beaton contacted Virgin who managed to retrieve the message which has now been permanently saved for him.

Rob Evans, executive director of engineering at Virgin Media, said finding it ""was like searching for a needle in a haystack"", however a team of 11 engineers spent three days tracking it down.

""The chances of its recovery were slim"" he said, but the missing file containing Ruby's voice was found on Friday.

""The next morning we called Stan to deliver the good news,"" he said.","1"
"A Husband Breaks Down In Tears After Lost Voicemail Message By His Late Wife Is Recovered","Stan Beaton had kept a voicemail from his late wife for 14 years when an upgrade to his phone line caused the recording to be deleted.

Work by Virgin Media caused the message, which was left by Beaton’s wife, Ruby, two years before her death in 2003, to be erased last month, the BBC reported.

The clip was recorded by Ruby to serve as the message people would hear when they called Beaton’s phone.

The 68-year-old told BBC Radio Leeds: “I’ve always resisted changing companies because whenever I mentioned that my wife’s voice was our voicemail message and would it be retained and each company said no, so that’s why I never changed.

“Sadly it disappeared. I was absolutely devastated by it, but also extremely angry.

“In the early days [I listened to it] quite often. Basically, it came to the point when if I felt low then I would listen to it.

“In December I learned that it had disappeared. I just could not tell people how it affected me at that time. It really did devastate me.”

Then, having heard Beaton’s story, a team of 11 engineers decided to try to recover the deleted audio recording.

Rob Evans, executive director of engineering at Virgin Media, told the BBC the task was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

“The chances of its recovery were slim,” he admitted.

But after three days of searching, the team found the message on Friday.

This is Beaton hearing his late wife’s message after it was recovered:

He said afterwards: “It’s just a wonderful, wonderful sound that I thought was lost forever.”

“I’m staggered at the lengths they have gone to.”

“They’ve made this old-age pensioner extremely happy,” he told the BBC.

Virgin Media is sending Beaton a CD of the recording and the retired forklift truck driver plans on thanking whoever delivers it in style.

“I’ve got a nice bottle of Glenfiddich with their name on it,” he told the Huddersfield Examiner.

Following the incident, Virgin pledged to make a series of donations to charities of Beaton’s choice as an apology.","1"
"""This is the recording you thought you'd lost forever""","LONDON -- Stan Beaton lost his wife a decade ago, so he cherished the simple voicemail greeting she had recorded at their home in northern England.

Then, without warning, it disappeared; deleted by his phone service provider, Virgin Media.

When Virgin heard about his story, BBC Radio Leeds reports, they set a team of 10 employees to the task of bringing the audio back, and the radio station was on hand this week to surprise Stan with a sound he believed he'd never hear again.

""That's her,"" he says choking up as he hears his late wife's voice. ""Wonderful. Wonderful.""

As Stan himself point's out to the BBC Radio reporter sitting in front of him, ""I suppose it's gonna be a bit of a PR job now, but thank you, Virgin Media.""

He said he was ""staggered"" at the lengths the company had gone to to retrieve it.

"WATCH: Stan Beaton cries tears of joy when phone engineers find treasured voicemail recording of his late wife he thought was lost forever","Widower Stan Beaton cried tears of joy after telephone engineers found the voicemail recording of his late wife he thought was lost forever.

Stan, 68, of Mirfield, was left devastated in December when an upgrade of his phone line by Virgin Media wiped the precious greeting he had kept for 14 years.

The retired forklift truck driver took comfort in the voice of wife Ruby, who died of stomach cancer aged 63 in May, 2003.

Stan had been assured by the phone company that the recording would be saved after the upgrade and the firm was forced to apologise and offered to make donations to Stan’s favourite charities after the blunder.

Red-faced bosses, though, didn’t stop there and put a team of 10 engineers on the case until the recording was recovered.

Stan was overcome with emotion when he was played a recording of the voicemail and said: “I felt pure elation and just couldn’t believe it. I thought the recording was gone forever.

“I can’t thank Virgin Media enough. Putting 10 people on the job must have cost them a fortune. I am staggered by that.”

Stan, who was married to Ruby for 20 years, often used to listen to the voicemail when he was feeling down.

He had previously tried to record the message to ensure it wasn’t lost but said: “All I ended up with were blank tapes.”

Virgin is planning to send a CD of the recording to Stan and the grateful pensioner has a treat for the engineer who finally retrieved the message.

“I’ve got a nice bottle of Glenfiddich with their name on it,” he said.","1"

In December, the message was lost during a service upgrade, which left the 68-year-old Brit ""absolutely devastated"" and also ""extremely angry,"" according to the BBC. So he contacted Virgin Media to see if they could retrieve it and -- with the help of nearly a dozen engineers -- they did.

"Stop Sharing Those Photos of Fancy International School Lunches","By now, you've probably seen (or even shared) the popular set of photos showing delicious, healthful school lunches from around the world, juxtaposed with a photo of the American equivalent, which of course looks like complete dogshit by comparison. Stop sharing it. The images aren't meant to show actual school lunches, and many versions replaced the original U.S. entry, which didn't seem that bad, with an intentionally gross one.

Before:

The photo gallery first appeared on the Tumblr of east coast salad chain Sweetgreen, to promote the company's donations toward healthy food for kids. Sweetgreen arranged and shot the meals themselves, based on the contents international lunches—these pretty, well-lit, probably organic versions of the dishes were never served in an actual cafeteria (as you'd think people would be able to tell from the same tray and background in every photo).

Stop Sharing Those Photos of Fancy International School Lunches

The meals aren't ""fake,"" they were just presented as representative of the kinds of dishes you'd find in various countries. But things started to get weird when sites began removing that context, replacing Sweetgreen's USA photo with a different one, and adding rants about Michelle Obama. Curse her and her totalitarian program of produce and whole grains! 

See, for example, the Daily Mail's story ""The School Lunches That Shame America,"" which does nothing to imply that the Sweetgreen photos aren't from actual school lunches, and an even worse Conservative Tribune post that was called out on Snopes. At least the Daily Mail version sources the gross mystery meat photo—it's tater tot casserole, by the way—to its origins on Twitter; the Conservative Tribune piece doesn't bother.

If America should be ashamed of its school lunches, it's not because they don't live up to a bunch of restaurant-quality food porn shot by an actual restaurant.

"iOS 8.2 may launch Monday with new health features","Version 8.2 of Apple's iOS mobile operating system could launch as soon as Monday with new and improved health features in tow. That's the same day the company is expected to unveil more details on its Apple Watch.

The maker of the iPhone and iPad mobile gadgets was close to releasing iOS 8.2 to the public earlier, blog Boy Genius Report said on Thursday, but instead decided to push out one final build to employees and testers. The change log for that build reveals several new features and enhancements in the health department as well as a host of bug fixes, according to BGR.

The Apple Watch faces an increasingly competitive market already crowded with devices from other players. To entice a wide range of buyers, Apple designed its first wearable as both a smartwatch and a health and fitness monitor. So the health features baked into iOS 8 need to be solid if Apple hopes to capture the fitness crowd.

Based on the change log, the new and improved health features in iOS 8.2:

add the ability to select the unit of measurement for body temperature, weight, height, distance and blood glucose,
improve stability when dealing with large amounts of data,
include the ability to add and visualize workout sessions from third-party apps,
address an issue that may have prevented users from adding a photo in Medical ID,
fix units for vitamins and minerals,
fix an issue where health data wouldn't refresh after changes in data source order,
fix an issue where some graphics showed no data values, and
add a privacy setting that enables turning off tracking of steps, distance and flights climbed.
But iOS 8.2 is also designed as a bug squasher.

Life hasn't exactly been easy for Apple's iOS 8 since it launched last September. The initial version carried a few bugs that were supposed to be resolved a week later in iOS 8.0.1. But that edition came with even more bugs, prompting Apple to quickly pull it and launch 8.0.2. Since then Apple has rolled out versions 8.1, 8.1.2 and 8.1.3, all with some enhancements and bug fixes.

The bugs and multiple releases may account for the sluggish adoption of iOS 8, which has trailed that of its predecessor but is finally up to 75 percent of all devices that visited the App Store as of last Monday.

According to BGR, the bug fixes:

address an issue in Maps that prevented navigating to some favorite locations,
address an issue where the last word in a quick reply message wasn't autocorrected,
fix an issue where duplicate iTunes purchased content could prevent iCloud restore from completing,
resolve an issue where some music or playlists didn't sync from iTunes to the Music app,
fix an issue where deleted audiobooks sometimes remained on the device,
resolve an issue that could prevent call audio from routing to car speakers while using Siri Eyes Free,
fix a Bluetooth calling issue where no audio is heard until the call is answered,
fix a timezone issue where Calendar events appear in GMT,
address an issue that caused certain events in a custom reoccurring meeting to drop from Exchange calendar,
fix a certificate error that prevented configuring an Exchange account behind a third-party gateway,
fix an issue that could cause an organizer's Exchange meeting notes to be overwritten, and
resolve an issue that prevented some Calendar events from automatically showing as ""busy"" after accepting an invite.
The update also promises greater stability for Mail, Music, the Flyover feature in Maps, VoiceOver reliability, and Connectivity with Made for iPhone Hearing Aids.

A spokeswoman for Apple declined CNET's request for comment. But you can learn more about the Apple Watch and see if iOS 8.2 really will launch Monday by tuning in to CNET's live blog and show starting at 9 a.m. PT Monday.","1"
"Pentagon: 1 weapons bundle seized by militants","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon is confirming that Islamic State group militants were able to seize one of the 28 bundles of weapons and medical supplies dropped to Kurdish forces on Monday.

Army Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, says that two of the bundles went astray. One was destroyed by the U.S. The other fell into enemy hands and included small weapons, hand grenades, medical supplies and ammunition. Warren said it appears the wind caused the parachute to go off course.

He says the weapons in the bundle are not enough to give the enemy any type of advantage.

Activists said Tuesday the weapons were seized by the extremist fighters. A video uploaded by a media group loyal to IS militants showed the extremists with the pallet of weapons and other materials.","1"

Video posted to a YouTube channel associated with ISIS shows them rifling through packages containing dozens of grenades.

The supply package was apparently one of many intended for Kurdish fighters who have been battling ISIS militants for control of the strategically important town for weeks. The footage has not been independently verified.

According to Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby, the majority of supplies were safely delivered to Kurdish forces, which have been supported by a U.S.-led coalition as they defend the town. However, Kirby said that at least one supply package may have fallen into the hands of the Islamic State.

""We are aware that one bundle was destroyed [via a video],"" said Kirby. ""Analysts are working as fast as they can to validate it.""

U.S. forces airdropped a total of 27 bundles containing weapons, ammunition and medical supplies early Monday. The supplies were provided by Kurdish authorities.

Kobani, located just yards from the Turkish border, has been the scene of an intense battle between Kurdish forces and ISIS militants, who attacked the area in late September.

"Video: Islamic State Claims to Have Captured US Weapons Airdrop Near Kobane","Islamic State (IS) fighters may have captured weapons airdropped by the US near the Syrian town of Kobane, intended for the Kurdish forces defending it against the jihadists' onslaught. 

A video posted on YouTube on Tuesday by a group calling itself ""A3maq News"" purports to show airdropped supplies in the hands of the extremist group. The footage shows a masked and armed militant examining a package attached to a parachute. Later, he looks into crates containing various munitions, including RPG rounds and grenades. 

The video could not immediately be independently verified, but A3maq News has previously posted IS-linked content and the some of the weapons seen in the video appear to match those possessed by Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which supplied the arms.

The grenades seen at 1:28 in the video are reported to be German-made. Berlin sent 10,000 grenades to Iraqi Kurdistan in August as part of a consignment of military aid provided to the KRG's peshmerga fighters, according to publicly available German government documents. 

Additionally, US Central Command confirmed in a statement on Monday that one airdropped bundle had missed its target,. However, CentCom said it had been destroyed in a follow-up airstrike to stop it falling into enemy hands. 


American C-130 planes delivered weapons, ammunition and medical supplies provided by the KRG to People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters at dawn on Sunday, according to a CentCom statement. The operation was intended to ""enable continued resistance against ISIL's attempts to overtake Kobane,"" CentCom added, using the former name for the Islamic State.

YPG spokesperson Redur Xelil told Reuters that the weapons would ""help greatly"" in the fight against IS. ""The military assistance dropped by American planes at dawn on Kobane was good and we thank America for this support,"" he said.

Kobane is surrounded on three sides by IS and is bordered to the north by Turkey. The Turkish government has thus far refused repeated requests to open a land corridor allowing humanitarian and military supplies into the town, leading to accusations of tacit complicity in the IS assault on the Kurds, whose struggle for greater autonomy has long been a thorn in Ankara's side. However, on Monday it announced that it would allow Iraqi Kurdish fighters to cross the border to the town.

The airdrops were the first of their kind, but the US launched a series of airstrikes on IS targets in August, then extended operations into Syria in September. American planes have now carried out more than 135 airstrikes against IS in Kobane, according to the Centcom statement, which it says are indicated to have ""slowed ISIL [S] advances into the city, killed hundreds of their fighters and destroyed or damaged scores of pieces of ISIL combat equipment and fighting positions.""

"ISIS Claims To Have Captured US Airdrop Weapons","A video released by the Islamic State on Tuesday allegedly shows a stray weapons bundle from the United States that missed its target in Kurdish-controlled areas near Kobani, Syria and instead fell into the hands of IS (ISIS or ISIL) militants.

Sunday evening, the Pentagon confirmed that the U.S. military had conducted a weapons drop to supply Syrian Kurds fighting IS militants in Kobani with small arms and supplies.

Pentagon Spokesperson Rear Adm. John Kirby also confirmed Monday that one of the bundles had missed its target, but that it had been destroyed so that “ISIL terrorists couldn’t get to it.”

The video, released by unofficial IS news agency Aamaq, bears the Arabic title: “Arms and ammunition delivered by American planes fell in areas controlled by the Islamic State in Kobani.”

The video shows an IS militant rifling through the weapons and supplies, which include grenades, explosive canisters, and RPG rounds.

“Thank God, the Mujahideen have them now,” the masked militant said.

"ISIS: We have our hands on weapons, ammo air-dropped by U.S.","In a new video posted online, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claims it has captured weapons and ammunition dropped by the U.S. military that was intended for Kurdish forces defending an embattled Syrian city near the Turkish border.

The airdrops Sunday were the first of their kind and followed weeks of U.S. and coalition airstrikes in and near Kobani.

In the video, ISIS claims some of the weapons and ammunition was air-dropped by mistake on its positions in Kobani.



A senior administration official told CBS News on Sunday that the majority - but not necessarily all - of the bundles dropped by U.S. forces appeared to ‎make it to their intended targets.

""We are still assessing the completion of the mission but every indication that we have is that the vast majority of those bundles were successfully delivered to Kurdish forces,"" the official said. ""We're still working through a complete assessment right now.‎""

Because the drops were made overnight, the Pentagon could not say with 100 certainty that they reached their intended destinations.

Idris Nassan, a senior Kurdish official from Kobani who is now in the Turkish town of Mursitpinar, confirmed the Kurdish fighters received the airdrop and asked for more weapons.

""We are not in need of fighters. We are able to defeat the terrorists of ISIS if we have weaponry - enough weaponry and enough ammunition,"" he told The Associated Press.

Kurdish fighters tweeted messages of appreciation along with photos that apparently show that some of the air-dropped cargo - including M-16 guns and medical supplies - did reach its intended recipients.","1"

"Turkish president says American weapons drop for Kurdish fighters was 'wrong' after supplies end up in the hands of ISIS","Turkey's president has said it was wrong for the United States to deliver military supplies to Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian city of Kobane after some of the weapons ended up in ISIS' hands.

The Pentagon claims the vast majority of the U.S. supplies dropped over the weekend had reached the Kurdish fighters despite an online video showing jihadists in possession of a bundle.

Tayyip Erdogan today said the mission had been a mistake - adding that he could not understand why the U.S. was so keen to defend Kobane as there were no longer any citizens in the city.

The weapons drop had been considered a highly sensitive subject for Turkey, who says the Kurdish fighter provided with American weapons are linked to the Kurdish People’s Protection Unit (YPG) – a group Ankara considers to be a terrorist organisation.

Error: Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said it was wrong for the United States to deliver military supplies to Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian city of Kobane after some of the weapons ended up in ISIS' hands

A still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border

Speaking at a news conference in Ankara today, Erdogan described the weapons drop as a mistake.

'What was done here on this subject turned out to be wrong. Why did it turn out wrong? Because some of the weapons they dropped from those C130s were seized by ISIL,’ he said, using an alternative acronym for ISIS.

Asked about a plan for Turkey to facilitate the passage of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters to Kobane to help in its defence, Erdogan said he proposed this move in a telephone call with Barack Obama at the weekend.

'I have difficulty understanding why KobanE is so strategic for them because there are no civilians there, just around 2,000 fighters,' Erdogan said.

'At first they didn't say yes to peshmergas, but then they gave a partial yes and we said we would help.'

A U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said

Earlier, the US Defense Department said is investigating video footage appearing to show Islamic State fanatics with at least one cache of weapons airdropped by coalition forces that was meant for Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

Yesterday ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss.

The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

"US probing claims ISIS fighters seized airdropped weapons meant for Kurds","mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');

U.S. military officials say they are investigating claims that Islamic State fighters seized a cache of weapons that were airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces and meant for Kurdish militiamen.

A video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State showed a cache of weapons including hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Their claims would appear to correspond with those of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said the militants had seized at least one cache.

U.S. officials said Tuesday they could not confirm the video's authenticity but are looking into the claims.

""We just don't know. We're still looking at it,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said when asked about the video, while stressing that the ""vast majority"" of supplies ended up in the right hands.

The supplies were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish border. The militant Islamic State has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

In all, 28 bundles of equipment -- including medical supplies, weapons and ammunition -- were dropped. The Pentagon says 27 bundles were received.

According to Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren, ""one of those bundles drifted off course."" But he said ""we subsequently destroyed it with an airstrike.""

On Tuesday, though, Islamic State loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said ""Team USA.""

Kirby acknowledged the conflicting accounts. ""We're aware that one bundle did not make it into the right hands and you saw the CENTCOM release indicating that they destroyed it from the air,"" he said. ""All of that doesn't take away from the notion that this video is out there and that it could in fact be that bundle. We just don't know.""

"Isis Syria News: Video Shows US Airdropped Weapons and Grenades 'Captured by Islamic State'","A pro-Isis news agency has released a video purportedly showing military aid airdropped by US forces and meant for Kurdish forces defending Kobani being captured by Islamic State (Isis) militants instead.

The two-minute long footage was allegedly filmed in the outskirts of the Syrian Kurdish-majority town, which has been besieged by jihadists after a fierce military assault.

In the clip, armed Isis fighters show several boxes containing weapons, munitions and grenades that were allegedly airdropped by US C-130 cargo planes and were from the Iraqi Kurdistan government. German-manufactured grenades can be also seen in the video, which was published by pro-Isis Amaq News agency.

On Sunday, the US military said it had air dropped weapons, ammunition and medical supplies to Kurdish forces defending Kobani. In a statement, the US central command said US C-130 cargo planes made multiple drops of arms and supplies that were provided by Kurdish authorities in Iraq, in order to allow Kurdish forces to resist Isis assault and take full control of Kobani.

According to Lahur Jangi Talabani, the director of the intelligence agency of the Kurdistan government, 24 tons of small arms and ammunition and 10 tons of medical supplies were delivered to Kurdish forces in three US planes.

"ISIS Video: America’s Air Dropped Weapons Now in Our Hands","In a new video, ISIS shows American-made weapons it says were intended for the Kurds but actually were air dropped into territory they control.

At least one bundle of U.S. weapons airdropped in Syria appears to have fallen into the hands of ISIS, a dangerous misfire in the American mission to speed aid to Kurdish forces making their stand in Kobani.

An ISIS-associated YouTube account posted a new video online Tuesday entitled, “Weapons and munitions dropped by American planes and landed in the areas controlled by the Islamic State in Kobani.” The video was also posted on the Twitter account of “a3maq news,” which acts as an unofficial media arm of ISIS. The outfit has previously posted videos of ISIS fighters firing American made Howitzer cannons and seizing marijuana fields in Syria.

ISIS had broadly advertised its acquisition of a broad range of U.S.-made weapons during its rampage across Iraq. ISIS videos have showed its fighters driving U.S. tanks, MRAPs, Humvees. There are unconfirmed reports ISIS has stolen three fighter planes from Iraqi bases it conquered.

The authenticity of this latest video could not be independently confirmed, but the ISIS fighters in the video are in possession of a rich bounty of American hand grenades, rounds for small rockets, and other supplies that they will surely turn around and use on the Kurdish forces they are fighting in and around the Turkish border city.

On Monday, White House Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes said the U.S. government was confident that the emergency airdropped supplies for the Kurdish forces near Kobani were falling into the right hands.

“We feel very confident that, when we air drop support as we did into Kobani… we’ve been able to hit the target in terms of reaching the people we want to reach,” Rhodes told CNN. “What I can assure people is that, when we are delivering aid now, we focus it on the people we want to receive that assistance. Those are civilians in need. Those are forces that we’re aligned with in the fight against ISIL [the government’s preferred acronym for ISIS], and we take precautions to make sure that it’s not falling into the wrong hands.”

Rhodes was responding to questions about a Monday report in The Daily Beast that U.S. humanitarian aid was flowing into ISIS controlled areas near Kobani by truck. That aid was mostly food and medical supplies, not the kind of lethal weapons in the new ISIS video.

Senior administration officials said Sunday that three American planes dropped a total of 27 bundles near Kobani and more U.S. air drops could come as part of the joint U.S.-Iraqi effort to aid Kurdish fighters in the Kobani area. The supplies were provided by Kurdish authorities, the official said.

In the new footage, the weapons appear to be U.S. made. There have also been at least 135 air strikes against ISIS in the area, according to the State Department.

The airstrikes and air drops appear to be having an impact. The Daily Beast’s Jamie Dettmer, reporting from the Syrian border, said the morale in Kobani has shifted in the last 24 hours. But ISIS continues to hold major swaths of territory in and around Kobani, despite widespread media reports to the contrary. And the civilians there are suffering, badly.

“I think what this represents is the President recognizes this is going to be a long-term campaign against ISIL; and that we need to look for whatever opportunity we can find to degrade that enemy and to support those who are fighting against ISIL on the ground,” a senior administration official told reporters.","1"

"Isis claims it has US airdrop of weapons","Pentagon investigating claims but admits one load missing and it would be embarrassing if it ended up in terror group’s hands

A US airdrop of arms to besieged Kurds in Kobani appears to have missed its target and ended up in the hands of Islamic State (Isis) militants.

Video footage released by Isis shows what appears to be one of its fighters for in desert scrubland with a stack of boxes attached to a parachute. The boxes are opened to show an array of weapons, some rusty, some new. A canister is broken out to reveal a hand grenade.

The Pentagon said it was investigating the claim but admitted that one of its airdrops had gone missing. If confirmed, it would be an embarrassment for the US, given the advanced precision technology available to its air force.

The seemingly bungled airdrop comes against a steady stream of US-supplied weapons being lost to Isis forces, mainly from the dysfunctional Iraqi army. Isis is reported to have stolen seven American M1 Abrams tanks from three Iraqi army bases in Anbar province last week.

The Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby, told reporters that analysts at Centcom headquarters in Tampa, Florida, were examining the video. “We’re still taking a look at it and assessing the validity of it,” he said. “So I honestly don’t know if that was one of the one dropped.”

The US began dropping munitions, supplied by Kurdish authorities in the semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq, to their compatriots in Kobani, which sits close to the Iraqi-Turkish border; Isis fighters have encircled much of the town.

Kirby confirmed the weapons shown in the video were the kind that were dropped. “So it’s not out of the realm of the possibility in that regard,” he said.

“I do want to add, though, that we are very confident that the vast majority of the bundles did end up in the right hands. In fact, we’re only aware of one bundle that did not.”

The airdrops were carried out by three C-130 planes. The video shows a man in camouflage clothes and balaclava looking through the boxes of munitions. He says they were dropped by US forces and had been intended for the Kurds. He described them as the spoils of war.

As well as grenades, the boxes appeared to contain parts for rocket-propelled grenades. Some of the equipment appears to be east European in origin, which might seem odd given the weapons were dropped by Americans, but the munitions were supplied by the Kurdish authorities who had been stocking up.

Kirby said the situation in Kobani remained tense, with Kurdish forces in control of most of the city. The US-led coalition has mounted more than 130 air strikes round the town in an effort to stop Isis taking complete control.

While the US has carried out air strikes in Kobani, cloud cover last week prevented them hitting much of the rest of Iraq, particularly around the contested Mosul dam. If the dam was to fall to I, it would provide huge leverage for the group, a strategic loss with potentially catastrophic consequences.

Britain has been supplying the Kurdish semi-autonomous region with weapons but so far supplies have been limited. The Kurds report receiving about 40 heavy machine guns but say they badly need heavier equipment, in particular armoured vehicles.","1"

A US airdrop of arms to besieged Kurds in Kobani appears to have missed its target and ended up in the hands of Islamic State (Isis) militants.

Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised the US air drops as a whole, saying it was “wrong” that weapons had indeed fallen into the hands of Isis, as well as the Kurdish fighters they were intended for. Turkey’s government sees the fighters as part of the Syrian arm of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a faction that has battled for self-rule in Turkey for over three decades.

“It has become clear that this was wrong,” Erdogan told reporters in Ankara. “It’s impossible to achieve results with such an operation,” he added.

In an abrupt shift, Turkey agreed on Monday to allow Iraqi Kurdish fighters to cross its territory and reinforce fellow Kurds in the besieged town of Kobani, but did not comment on whether it backed the air drops.

"Isis apparently takes control of US weapons airdrop intended for Kurds","· Pentagon admits one of 28 loads missing and blames wind· Turkey criticises arms airdrops saying the strategy will never lead to desired results

The Pentagon admitted on Wednesday that one of the airdrops of weapons intended for Kurds in the besieged Syrian town of Kobani almost certainly ended up in the hands of the Islamic State (Isis) fighters.

The Pentagon blamed the wind for possibly blowing the supplies off course and argued that one cache was not enough to make a significant difference to Isis.

Video footage released by Isis shows what appears to be one of its fighters in desert scrubland with a stack of boxes attached to a parachute. The boxes are opened to show an array of weapons, some rusty, some new. A canister is broken out to reveal a hand grenade. Other equipment appeared to be parts for rocket-propelled grenades.

The Pentagon said the pallet of weapons was one of 28 dropped, not six as previously reported.

US defence spokesman Army Lieutenant Colonel Steve Warren said: “One bundle worth of equipment is not enough equipment to give the enemy any type of advantage at all. It’s a relatively small amount of supplies. This is stuff [Isis] already has.”

The Pentagon cleared up some confusion about a cache going astray on Sunday that had subsequently been destroyed in a US strike, once it had been realised it was in danger of falling into Isis hands.

Warren said two caches had gone astray but the air force had managed to destroy one. A steady stream of US-supplied weapons are being lost to Isis forces, mainly from the dysfunctional Iraqi army. Isis is reported to have stolen seven American M1 Abrams tanks from three Iraqi army bases in Anbar province last week.

A spokesman for the Pentagon, Rear Admiral John Kirby, told reporters that analysts at Centcom headquarters in Tampa, Florida, were examining the video. “We’re still taking a look at it and assessing the validity of it,” he said. “So I honestly don’t know if that [box] was one of the ones dropped.” he said.

"U.S. accidentally delivered weapons to the Islamic State by airdrop, militants say","This post has been updated with additional reporting.

The Islamic State has released a new video in which it brags that it recovered weapons and supplies that the U.S. military intended to deliver to Kurdish fighters, who are locked in a fight with the militants over control of the Syrian border town of Kobane.

The SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist social media accounts, drew attention to the video Tuesday. At one point, it appears to show a masked militant raking his hands through a crate filled with hand grenades.

A U.S. Central Command spokesman said he was looking into the reports. In a news release Monday, U.S. military officials acknowledged launching one airstrike near Kobane that they said destroyed “a U.S. airdrop of Kurdish supplies” to prevent “these supplies from falling into enemy hands.”

“All other resupply bundles were successfully delivered,” the CENTCOM news release said, without specifying what was in the shipment.

Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said Tuesday afternoon that analysts were working to determine what happened. The Defense Department is aware that one bundle didn’t make it into the right hands, and is not sure whether the one that appears in the video is the same one CENTCOM already reported destroying.

On Tuesday, the U.S. military announced another four airstrikes near Kobane, saying it hit Islamic State fighting positions, a building occupied by the militants, and “a large ISIL unit,” using one of the acronyms for the group. The U.S. has launched dozens of airstrikes around Kobane in the last week, as the militants besiege the town.

The incident highlights the difficulty in making sure all airdrops are accurate, even with GPS-guided parachutes that the Air Force commonly uses. Airdrops of food and water to religious minorities trapped on mountain cliffs in northern Iraq in August hit the mark about 80 percent of the time, Pentagon officials said at the time.

The United States began dropping weapons, ammunition, medical supplies and other equipment to fighters defending Kobane on Sunday night, in part because Turkey would not allow Kurdish fighters to cross its borders into Kobane to bolster the town’s defenses. Turkish officials said they changed their mind on Monday, but the deal is tentative and depends on whether separate Kurdish groups can resolve longterm differences to confront the Islamic State.

"An accidental delivery of arms to the Islamic State and the problem with airdrops","There it was in the middle of a field, baking in the sun: a cache of grenades, rockets and guns. The trove was attached to a big black parachute and, as the camera focused in on the shipment, it seemed for a moment abandoned. Then you see the masked man, who sermonized for the occasion. An American airdrop of arms, he said, which had been intended for Kurdish fighters defending the city of Kobane, had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State.

“These are some of the American aid [items] that were dropped for the atheists in the” Kurdistan Workers’ Party,” the militant said in a video uploaded to jihadist social media accounts and initially reported by SITE Intelligence Group. “Ammunition, military equipment, additional equipment — these are some of the military weapons. The American forces dropped [them] … Praise be to Allah. Spoils for the mujahideen.”

News of the accidental airdrop, which the Associated Press corroborated and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed, brought fresh criticism to a military tactic — the air drop — officials said has become substantially more accurate in the past few decades, but is still evidently prone to screw-ups. And those screw-ups have popped up several times so far in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, underscoring the dangers of trusting the winds to carry valuable resources to their targets.

In early August, the U.S. military dropped more than 7,000 gallons of water and 36,000 packaged meals onto a barren mountain near Sinjar, the hiding spot for nearly 40,000 Yazidis who fled the Islamic State under threat of genocide. Many packages reached their intended targets — the Department of Defense estimated 80 percent — but not all of them did. “Iraqi officials said that much of the U.S. aid had been ‘useless’ because it was dropped from 15,000 feet without parachutes and exploded on impact,” wrote journalist Jonathan Krohn, who claimed to be the first Western journalist on the scene. The Washington Post’s Liz Sly agreed, saying the drops “apparently went awry.”

Then NBC News reported late last month Iraqi military pilots accidentally dropped food, water and weapons to Islamic State fighters instead of to their own soldiers, who were battling to retain control of Anbar province. “Some pilots, instead of dropping these supplies over the area of the Iraqi army, threw it over an area that is controlled by ISIS fighters,” Hakim al-Zamili said, using another name for the Islamic State. “Those soldiers were in deadly need of these supplies, but because of the wrong plans of the commanders in the Iraqi army and lack of experience of the pilots, we in a way or another helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers.”

Another general sheepishly added: “Yes, that’s what had happened.”

The embarrassing anecdotes feed into the complicated history of the airdrop, which still carries risks despite being honed over decades with technological advancements such as GPS-guided parachutes. “There’s no way you can predict who may end up with those weapons, and who is going to use them, or how they are going to use them,” Greg Myre of the Middle East Institute told the Daily Sabah. “That is one of the risks you have to take.”

It was a risk Bill Clinton was willing to take in 1993. That was the year he ordered an airdrop of tens of thousands of humanitarian packages over eastern Bosnia, despite the “military consistently arguing against involving U.S. troops in airdrops in hostile zones, given the fact that the accuracy of the drops is questionable,” the Associated Press then reported. The brass turned out to be right.

One major problem laid bare during that mission, military scientists later said, was what they called “wind drift.” “The problem was identified in the late ’90s,” John McGinley, a scientist who researched the topic, told The Washington Post’s Holly Watt in 2008. “The terrain in Bosnia meant that instead of landing in one valley, the cargo could drift into another valley that was held by the enemy. Wind drift was causing all the problems.”

So research teams got to work, ultimately unveiling wind-forecast software that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said increased the drop’s accuracy by 70 percent. “Inaccurate wind forecasts are the main culprit in missed targets for dropping supplies and other items from high altitudes,” the report said.

It almost immediately went into use in the war in Afghanistan, where far-flung military outposts were separated by stretches of roads pockmarked with insurgents and explosives. There had to be another way to get soldiers the equipment they needed, military officials thought, so they launched a massive increase in airdrops. “We’ve gotten a lot more accurate over the years,” Air Force Gen. Arthur Lichte told USA Today.

That may true. But following this week’s alleged delivery to the Islamic State, there’s clearly still room for work.","1"

"Cameron vows to hunt down IS 'monsters' after Haines murder","UK Prime Minister David Cameron denounced the Islamic State (IS) jihadist organisation as “monsters” Sunday after the Foreign Office said a video showing the murder of a British aid worker appeared to be authentic.

""All the signs are that the video is genuine, we have no reason to believe that it's not,"" a spokesman for the Foreign Office told AFP.

The video showing the beheading of David Haines, who was abducted in Syria last year, was released by IS militants late Saturday. It was the third beheading of a Western hostage by the group in less than a month.

After chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee Sunday, Cameron condemned IS, which has conquered vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria in recent months, as the ""embodiment of evil"" and vowed that the UK would do everything possible to find Haines’s killers.

""We will hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice, no matter how long it takes,"" the grim-faced premier said in a televised statement from Downing Street.

He continued: ""Step by step we must drive back, dismantle and ultimately destroy ISIL (IS) and what is stands for. We will do so in a calm, deliberate way but with an iron determination.

""We will not do so on our own, but by working closely with our allies, not just the United States and in Europe, but with our allies in the region.""

US President Barack Obama said after the killing that the United States would stand with Britain in an expanded effort against the terror group.

“We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world,” he said.

No comment on air strikes

Haines, 44, had been taken hostage in Syria in March 2013 while working for the French NGO ACTED, which was helping thousands of Syrians displaced by the fighting between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces and rebel groups, including IS, seeking to oust him.

Cameron described 44-year-old Haines as a ""British hero"", saying that ""his selflessness, his decency, his burning desire to help others has today cost him his life"".

Those who killed him ""are not Muslims, they are monsters"", he said.

Cameron repeated his support for US air strikes against IS in Iraq, and for President Obama's strategy to build a broad coalition to fight the jihadists.

But despite growing calls at home for action against IS, Cameron made no commitment to Britain joining the air strikes.

London began sending arms this week to Kurdish fighters battling IS militants in northern Iraq, but it has faced accusations of confusion over its strategy.

During a visit to Berlin this week, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain would not take part in strikes against IS in Syria, after parliament last year voted against taking military action in that country.

But just hours later, a spokesman for Cameron's Downing Street office insisted the prime minister was not ruling anything out.

In the footage of Haines’s murder, a hooded militant blames Cameron for joining forces with the United States and says the alliance will drag the British people into ""another bloody and unwinnable war"".

‘Barbaric crime must not remain unpunished’

In a statement, ACTED said it was “deeply appalled and horrified” by the murder.

“David was a new member of the ACTED team supporting the emergency humanitarian response for the displaced Syrian people in Atmeh camp near to the Turkish border,” it said.

“David was appreciated by the ACTED team and all those around him, notably for his generosity, commitment, and his professionalism.

“The horrible assassination of David, an aid worker, goes against all humanitarian principles and is a crime against humanity. This barbaric crime must not remain unpunished.”

Before joining ACTED, Haines had also worked for groups such as Handicap International, which helps the disabled during conflicts, and Nonviolent Peaceforce, which sends unarmed peacekeepers into conflict zones. He had previously been in Libya during its civil war and South Sudan.

His brother, Mike Haines, said he had also worked for the United Nations in the Balkans “helping people in real need”.

“His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair,” Mike Haines said. “He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly.”

"David Haines Beheaded By ISIS, Execution Video Contains Threats Against UK: Reports","Islamic State militants have released a video which purportedly shows the beheading of British citizen David Haines, multiple unconfirmed reports said. The 44-year-old aid worker was kidnapped in March 2013.

Islamic State releases video showing beheading of British aid worker David Haines

— SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) September 13, 2014

Stills from the purported Haines execution video were released to the Internet Saturday, al-Jazeera reported. In the footage, a masked man claims Haines was killed because the United Kingdom said it would arm Kurdish fighters to combat ISIS in Iraq.

“This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State,” the masked men reportedly said, addressing U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron. The video also contains a threat to second British hostage.

This time around, the message from the Islamic State is very much aimed at @David_Cameron, with a 2nd British hostage threatened.

â€” Brown Moses (@Brown_Moses) September 13, 2014

The UK Foreign Office is ""working urgently"" to verify the authenticity of the alleged Haines beheading video, Sky News reports. If verified, the execution would constitute ""another disgusting murder,"" the government organization said.

Haines’ relatives pleaded Saturday with ISIS to “make contact” and respond to their messages, NBC News reported. “We are the family of David Haines,” the relatives said in a statement. “We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

The British aid worker was identified as ISIS’ next target for beheading in the video which showed the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff. Militants vowed to kill Haines if the United States military did not end military operations against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

"ISIS Video Purports To Show Beheading Of British Aid Worker","Update at 8:50 p.m. EDT

The militant group that calls itself the Islamic State has released a video that purportedly shows the beheading of British aid worker David Haines.

The authenticity of the video, which appeared online Saturday, has not been independently confirmed by NPR.

The organization, also known as ISIS, had threatened to kill Haines just under two weeks ago, in an earlier video that showed the beheading of an American journalist. This weekend, Haines' family had issued a public plea to his captors through the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The family asked ISIS to make contact with them.

Haines, an international aid worker, was abducted in Syria in 2013. ""The British government had managed to keep his kidnapping secret out of concern for his safety until the most recent video Islamic State video identified him as a captive,"" the AP writes.

The BBC reports that the 44-year-old father of two from Perth, Scotland, was kidnapped shortly after he began working with a French relief agency called ACTED. At his posting there, Haines was ""working in the Atmeh refugee camp ... supplying water, food and tents.""

Over the past decade and a half he'd worked with a variety of aid agencies, writes the BBC: ""He had worked with a German charity on post-war reconstruction projects in Croatia, including housing and demining. He was also involved in efforts to help displaced people to return to their homes. In 2011 he became Head of Mission in Libya for Handicap International,"" an organization that works to help vulnerable people with disabilities.

""The following year he joined another agency, the Nonviolence Peaceforce (NP), and went to South Sudan,"" where he worked as an unarmed civilian peacekeeper.

ISIS previously released two videos showing the beheadings of two American journalists, which were confirmed by U.S. officials to be authentic. The first video, which showed the killing of James Foley, was released on August 20. The second, which showed the beheading of Steven Sotloff and contained the threat directed towards Haines, was released on Sept. 2.

The newest video, like those previous videos, appears to name another Western hostage as a future target.

NPR's correspondent Alice Fordham, reporting for our Newscast unit, says the video begins with footage of British prime minister David Cameron. The two previous videos began with footage of President Obama.

The man identified as Haines, Alice reports, is shown ""kneeling in a featureless desert in an orange robe.""

The video appears to be recent, Alice says: ""The assailant refers to the bombing of Iraq's Haditha dam a week ago. Another man identified as a British hostage appears at the end as the masked man exhorts Prime Minister Cameron to stop fighting the Islamic State.""

Cameron has tweeted a response, writing, ""We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.""

President Obama said in a statement that the U.S. ""strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group ISIL,"" and pledged to work with the U.K. and other nations to ""bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice.""","1"

"British hostage David Haines beheaded by Islamic State terrorists","Islamic State has released a video showing the beheading of British hostage David Haines.

It comes just hours after his family issued a public plea for his captors to contact them.

The Foreign Office said it was ""working urgently to verify"" the video and offering Mr Haines's family support.

David Cameron, the Prime Minister, said: ""The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude.""

He added: ""We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.""

Mr Haines, 44, was kidnapped last year as he delivered humanitarian aid in Syria.

His whereabouts were only revealed this month when he was shown kneeling in the sand, wearing an orange jumpsuit, in a video produced by jihadists of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) which also showed the murder of Steven Sotloff, an American journalist.

A masked man, who has become known as “Jihadi John”, said Mr Haines would be next if the West did not halt operations against Isil.

In the latest video, he is also wearing a orange jumpsuit and is kneeling on the sand.

It begins with a clip from David Cameron. A man believed to be Mr Haines then looks into the camera and says: ""My name is David Cawthorne Haines. I would like to delcare that I hold you David Cameron entirely responsible for my execution.

""You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State just as your predecessor Tony Blair did, following a trend against our British prime ministers who can't find the courage to say no to the Americans.

""Unfortunately it is we the British public that in the end will pay the price for our Parliament's selfish decisions.""

Twitter: David Cameron - The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude.

Twitter: David Cameron - We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.

In a statement, the Foreign and Commonwealth said: ""We are aware of the video.

""We are working urgently to verify the content. If true, this is another disgusting murder. We are offering the family every support possible.

""They have asked to be left alone at this time.""

Mr Cameron rushed back to Downing Street for crisis talks with his advisers, officials and intelligence chiefs on Saturday night. He arrived at No 10 just after midnight.

He chaired a COBRA meeting on Sunday morning.

In the Haines family’s short statement - which was released earlier on Saturday by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office - the British captive’s relatives said: “We are the family of David Haines.

“We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply.We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

No further details of their messages were released.

Mr Haines had worked for aid agencies in some of the world’s worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan.

He was travelling in a car through northern Syria in March last year when he was abducted along with an Italian colleague, who was later released. He was working for a French aid organisation, Agency for Technical Co-operation and Development (Acted).

Mr Haines is believed to have been kidnapped by a gang which later sold him on to Isil.

His identity remained a closely guarded secret for 19 months in a bid to increase the chances of a negotiated release.

But the situation changed dramatically with the execution first of James Foley, another American journalist, and then Mr Sotloff with the subsequent appearance of Mr Haines in the second murder video.

MPs reacted with horror and anger to the reports on Saturday night.

Ed Vaizey, a government minister and Conservative MP, said he was “so sad and angry” to hear reports of Mr Haines’s murder.

Stella Creasy, a Labour MP and shadow minister, said she was “shocked and horrified” to see reports that Mr Haines had been killed. “Hoping mistaken but fear not,” she said.

Dan Jarvis, another senior Labour MP, said he was “sickened”.

Tim Farron, President of the Liberal Democrats, said: “My thoughts and prayers are with David Haines' family and friends tonight.”

Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said: “I am sickened at the disgusting, barbaric killing of David Haines.

“He was somebody whose only purpose was to help innocent people, themselves victims of conflict.

“That ISIL would choose to kill him says everything about their warped logic and murderous ways.

“Acts like this will not weaken but strengthen the resolve of Britain and the international community to defeat ISIL and their ideology.

“My deepest condolences and thoughts are with his family as they cope with this terrible crime. And the hearts of the British people will go out to them.”

Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said the UK should respond by playing its role in the assault against IS promised by US president Barack Obama.

""What we absolutely need to do is not be cowed in any way by yet another foul murder of a hostage,"" he told Sky News.

""But to develop the strategy into a sensible military campaign in coalition with regional players such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries in the area.

""We can support them to confront, attack and defeat the Islamic State jihadi fighters ... and make sure this cancer is removed from the region before it spreads more widely.""

The United States also ""strongly condemned"" the killing.

In a statement, the White House said: ""Our hearts go out to the family of Mr Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom. The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve.

""We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.""","1"
"Isis video claims to show beheading of British hostage David Haines","Militants with the Islamic State jihadi group have released a video that appears to show the beheading of a British hostage, David Haines, an aid worker who was captured just days after he arrived in Syria last year.

British government officials were seeking to authenticate the video which purported to show the final moments of Haines, who was 44.

In the video, entitled A Message to the Allies of America, a masked man is shown carrying out the beheading of Haines, whose life had earlier been threatened in a film showing the murder of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The video, which runs to two minutes and 28 seconds, ends with a warning that a second British hostage would be the next to die. He has been named in international media and on social media as Alan Henning, a British aid worker.

Haines is the third western hostage and the first Briton to be killed in this fashion by Isis – the first, US journalist James Foley, was murdered in a video released on 19 August.

The British prime minister, David Cameron, issued a statement denouncing the killing. “This is a despicable and appalling murder of an innocent aid worker. It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal.

“We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.”

Cameron will gather senior representatives of the military and security services and the Foreign Office and Home Office in Whitehall to discuss the situation.

The US president, Barack Obama, also condemned the killing. “The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group Isil,” he said, using his administration’s preferred acronym for Isis. “Our hearts go out to the family of Mr Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom.

“The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve. We will work with the UK and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.”

The recording features a voiceover delivered by an Isis militant, whose voice and accent closely resembles that of the killer in both the Sotloff and Foley videos. The killer directly addresses Cameron, saying that Haines “has to pay the price for your promise” to arm Kurdish peshmerga fighters against Isis.

Speaking to the camera, the hostage, composed but clearly under duress, and wearing an orange jumpsuit, reads out a statement in which he says that Cameron is “entirely responsible for my execution” for entering into a coalition with the US.

Haines, who was in the Royal Air Force for 12 years before moving into aid work, addresses Cameron, saying: “You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor, Tony Blair, did, following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who can’t find the courage to say no to the Americans.

“Unfortunately, it is we, the British public, that will in the end pay the price for our parliament’s selfish decisions.”

The killer, swathed in black, then makes a statement in which he makes a direct reference to the British government’s aid to Kurdish fighters.

He says: “This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State. Ironically, he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force that is responsible for delivering those arms.

“Your evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam will only accelerate your destruction. And playing the role of the obedient lapdog, Cameron, will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war.”

At the end of the latest video, another hostage, Henning, is paraded.

The US carried out at least nine air strikes last week on Isis militants threatening the Haditha dam. The bombing was cited by Haines’s killer in the video.

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office in London said: “We are aware of the video and are working urgently to verify the contents.”

Isis had threatened to kill Haines, a father of two, in a video that emerged 11 days ago in which Sotloff was murdered. Less than 24 hours before the latest video emerged, the Haines family had made a plea to the jihadis to respond to their efforts to make contact.

The family statement, which was released by the Foreign Office and addressed the militants directly, said: “We are the family of David Haines. We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

Haines was born in East Yorkshire but raised in Perthshire, and before his capture was living in Croatia with his second wife Dragana.

He had a 17-year-old daughter with his first wife Louise, and a four-year-old daughter with Dragana, who has described him as a “fantastic man and father”. He was kidnapped while working for the aid organisation Acted, having previously worked in Libya and South Sudan.

A meeting of the British government’s emergency committee, Cobra, is expected to be called imminently and the prime minister’s attentions will be diverted from the referendum on Scottish independence, due to take place on Thursday.

Haines had worked for aid agencies in some of the world’s worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan.

He was in Libya during its civil war in 2011, working as head of mission for Handicap International, which helps disabled people in poverty and conflict zones around the world.","1"

"Does ISIS Have Ebola? Probably Not! Media Reports It Anyway","The New York Post decided that it was a good idea to report that members of ISIS may have been infected with Ebola. In other news, Andy Borowitz has been hired at the New York Post. (Haha, no, kidding. Can you imagine, though?)

Apparently, the World Health Organization is investigating claims made by Iraqi newspaper Al-Sabah that Ebola and HIV-AIDS are spreading among residents of Mosul, brought there by ""terrorists and expats from different countries, especially Africa."" Mosul is held by ISIS; Al-Sabah is the official Iraqi government newspaper.

Mashable reports that the story, which originated in Al-Sabah, has spread amongst other pro-government and Kurdish newspapers. Like a virus! Might such outlets have an interest in encouraging the notion that ISIS fighters were stricken with highly-stigmatized diseases? Hmm.

Meanwhile, Forbes reported in October that ISIS maybe possibly could use Ebola as a weapon:

So maybe that ridiculous scenario is coming to pass. Maybe! Maybe. There's just no way for us to know for sure. Then again, ""We've seen no specific credible intelligence that [ISIS] is attempting to use any sort of disease or virus to attack our homeland,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in October.

Oh, and also, according to Iraq's Ministry of Health, there are no doctors in Mosul that have the capacity to diagnose Ebola. The reports are ""incorrect"" and ""unfounded,"" a ministry spokesman said.

"WHO says reports of suspected Ebola cases in Iraq are untrue","LONDON (Reuters) - No suspected cases of Ebola have been found in Iraq, despite reports to the contrary in Iraqi media in the past week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.

Describing reports of suspect cases of the deadly viral infection in Mosul as ""rumor"", the Geneva-based United Nations health agency said it and the Iraqi health ministry had conducted a full investigation.

""All sources contacted have negated the existence of any suspected cases of Ebola,"" the WHO said in a statement.

""The (Iraqi) Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization further confirmed that the laboratory facilities in Mosul do not have the necessary capabilities to diagnose and confirm the Ebola virus.""

Reports of suspected Ebola cases appeared on Dec. 31 in Iraq's Al-Sabah newspaper, Rudaw online newspaper and on the Shafaq news agency and were relayed through other media in and outside Iraq, prompting the WHO and Iraqi authorities to investigate.

"Officials Refute Iraqi Media Reports That ISIS Members Have Contracted Ebola In Mosul","The two biggest news stories of 2014 collided Wednesday when Iraqi media outlets reported that members of the Islamic State group -- also known as ISIS -- had contracted the deadly virus Ebola. But later updates from the World Health Organization and Iraq's Ministry of Health indicate the stories may be just rumors.

""We have no official notification ... that it is Ebola,"" Christy Feig, director of communications for WHO, told Mashable, though WHO has contacted Iraqi officials to offer help.

Iraq's Ministry of Health also denied that anyone in Mosul had contracted the Ebola virus, which broke out in March in West Africa. Spokesman Ahmed Rudaini told news site Al-Maalomah that Mosul doesn't even have the technological capability to diagnose Ebola cases -- only Baghdad does. Therefore, he said, the reports that Ebola has infected anyone in Mosul are ""incorrect"" and ""unfounded.""

The discussion started with an article in Iraq's official newspaper, Al-Sabah, that said ""terrorists"" brought Ebola to Mosul. ""Many diseases and epidemics have spread among residents of the city of Mosul,"" it read. ""Two Ebola and 26 HIV/AIDS cases were registered.""

Ebola is primarily a threat in West Africa, where its latest outbreak has killed nearly 8,000 people. Mashable reported ISIS has not recruited fighters from any countries severely affected by the disease. Its African members are primarily from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia.

In the event ISIS does have Ebola, the militants could use it as a biological terror technique, Forbes reported in October. Members could contract the virus on purpose and then go to foreign countries to infect others. “The individual exposed to the Ebola virus would be the carrier,” national security professor Al Shimkus told Forbes. “In the context of terrorist activity, it doesn’t take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.”

ISIS, a body of militants labeled a terrorist group by the United States and European Union (among others), has controlled Mosul since June. Iraq's second-largest city is also ISIS' largest stronghold. The group began spreading across the Middle East last summer, taking over large swaths of Iraq and Syria through brutal tactics.","1"
"WHO: Isis does not have Ebola – but contingency plan being developed for Iraq","The Islamic State (Isis) operating in Iraq does not have Ebola, the World Health Organization has confirmed.

Last week a number of reports emerged suggesting members of the terrorist organisation had contracted the disease.

The Daily Mail reported that three media outlets had said a number of militants had shown signs of the deadly virus in the city of Mosul.

Speaking to Mashable, a WHO spokesperson said they were investigating the reports. ""We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,"" Christy Feig, WHO's director of communications, told the website.

The organisation has now confirmed there are no suspected cases of Ebola in Iraq as of 5 January.

""On 31 December, 2014, Al-Sabah newspaper, Shafaq news agency and Rudaw online newspaper reported a rumour of EVD cases in Mosul, Ninewa governorate,"" WHO said in a statement. ""The news was also relayed through other media agencies in and outside of Iraq.

""Following this rumour, the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization investigated the allegations through existing surveillance networks, as well as through contacts with health authorities and medical sources in Ibn Sina Hospital in Mosul.

""All sources contacted have negated the existence of any suspected cases of Ebola. The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization further confirmed that the laboratory facilities in Mosul do not have the necessary capabilities to diagnose and confirm the Ebola Virus.""

It said both the Ministry of Health and WHO has scaled up surveillance efforts to ensure early detection of any suspected Ebola cases, and that all precautionary measures are being taken to prevent the disease from entering Iraq.

""The surveillance efforts have been scaled up at all health facilities to ensure that any imported or suspected cases are promptly detected.

""A contingency and response plan is currently under development.""

"Reports Isis fighters have contracted Ebola are 'incorrect', says Iraqi health ministry","A spokesman for the Iraqi health ministry denied reports in a local newspaper that militants in Mosul had Ebola

Reports that Isis fighters in Iraq have contracted Ebola have been refuted as “incorrect” and “unfounded” by the country’s health ministry.

Despite reports on Wednesday in the Iraqi paper, al-Sabah, that two cases of Ebola had been reported in Mosul in the north of the country, Ahmed Rudaini, the health ministry’s spokesman dismissed the speculation.

He said the disease could not have been registered, as only the Central Laboratory of Public Health in Baghdad has the “diagnostic capabilities” to confirm cases of Ebola which was reported by the al-Maalomah news website and the International Business Times.

The World Health Organisation also confirmed that they had received no confirmation of Ebola cases from Iraq.

Tarik Jasarevic from the organisation told The Independent: ""WHO is aware of these reports and is working closely with Iraqi MoH to get more information.

""It is unlikely that this case can be a confirmed Ebola case as there is no laboratory facility in Mosul that could do an Ebola test.""

WHO’s director of communications, Christy Feig had earlier told Mashable: “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.”

The organisation has reached out to the Iraqi government to investigate the claims, should it require assistance, however.

Al-Sabah initially reported that “terrorists” from several unnamed African countries had brought the virus to the country and claimed that two cases of Ebola and 26 cases of HIV/AIDS had been registered by authorities.

Although Isis has recruited foreign fighters in the past, it believed that the majority came from Tunisia, according to a Washington Post report. Very few, if any, militants are thought to have travelled from at-risk areas of West Africa, including Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

The northern city of Mosul fell to Isis six months ago and residents have suffered brutal repression. People are restricted from leaving the city without first nominating a guarantor, water and food supplies are limited and hospitals have been closed due to a lack of electricity.","1"

"No, there aren’t any Ebola cases in Iraq","Iraq has many problems. Ebola isn’t one of them.

The World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health in Iraq made that clear in a statement late Monday, saying there are no suspected infections from the deadly virus in the country. That came after rumors spread online and through several media outlets on Dec. 31. Most of them cited anonymous medical sources in the city of Mosul, which has been under the control of Islamic State militants since June.

The virus spreading through Iraq would have raised concerns for both the local population and American troops who recently began training the Iraqi military. According to the discredited reports, the virus was said to have been brought to Iraq by militants and other migrants coming to the country from Africa.

Health officials said that simply isn’t true. The Ministry of Health and World Health Organization investigated the reports through surveillance networks and contacts with medical sources in Mosul, and found that there were no cases of the virus.

“The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization further confirmed that the laboratory facilities in Mosul do not have the necessary capabilities to diagnose and confirm the Ebola Virus,” according to the joint statement–a question that was raised by skeptics when the rumors spread last week.

Here’s a sampling of tweets on the rumors before the announcement:

"DHS Rebuffs Congressman’s Claim ISIS Infiltrating Southern Border","The Department of Homeland Security is denying a congressman’s assertion that fighters with the militant group Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, have been caught crossing the southwestern border.

“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

""I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,"" Hunter claimed. ""There's nobody talking about it.""

""If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,"" he continued.

One source close to Hunter worked to walk back the comment, emphasizing that the congressman received a tip from a “high level” source at U.S. Customs and Border Protection who told him that a group of people with “suspected ISIS affiliation” –- even Americans who traveled to Syria to fight with the Free Syrian Army against President Bashar al-Assad –- were apprehended at the border.

The tip ""was from a confidential source with the Border Patrol,"" the source said in an email. ""[It’s] more accurate to say people with known associations. Not 'fighters' in the sense folks might immediately think.""

While DHS and several other congressional sources shot down the claim outright, a spokesman for Hunter said that the congressman fears ISIS sympathizers could easily melt into U.S. cities and breed home-grown terrorism.

“The Congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,” Joe Kasper, deputy chief of staff to Hunter, wrote in response to the DHS denial. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

Customs and Border Protection is part of DHS.

Hunter’s office declined an ABC News request to interview the congressman.

"""Categorically False"": DHS Debunks Right-Wing Fiction That ISIS Attempted To Cross The U.S.- Mexico Border","The Department of Homeland Security definitively debunked the persistent right-wing media conspiracy theory that Islamic State fighters have attempted to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, saying the rumor is not supported by any ""credible intelligence"" and knocking the claim that the terrorists have been apprehended at the border as ""categorically false."" 

What began early this summer as an unsubstantiated claim from Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) that ""people that are coming [across the U.S.-Mexico border] from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations,"" (a claim PolitiFact Texas rated ""Pants on Fire""), has morphed into a full-blown right-wing conspiracy theory. Conservative media and elected officials are hyping fears that members of the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL) terrorist group are utilizing the U.S.-Mexico border to enter the U.S. and launch terrorist attacks, a chorus that has only grown louder in the ensuing months to attack immigration reform.

In September, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) claimed to have seen information detailing ""four individuals trying to cross through the Texas border who were apprehended at two different stations that do have ties to known terrorists organizations in the Middle East,"" a story subsequently hyped by Fox News. Nearly a month later, the number had jumped from four terrorists allegedly apprehended to 10.

Fox News' On The Record provided a platform to Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) who claimed to have first-hand knowledge of the terrorists crossing the border. Host Greta Van Susteren replied to Hunter's allegations by asking, ""Do you have any information, or any evidence, that they are actually coming in the southern border now?"" And Hunter responded, ""Yes. ... I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,"" citing information he'd received from border patrol agents.



But the right-wing talking point is ""categorically false,"" according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border security. On October 8, DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron refuted the rumor that Islamic State terrorists had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, telling The New Republic: 

""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" said DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

It remains to be seen whether DHS's facts permeate the right-wing bubble. After hearing the DHS statement, Sean Hannity claimed on his radio program that the agency could not be trusted and suggested it may be lying.","1"
"Officials shoot down congressman's claims ISIS terrorists are running across US-Mexico border","Federal officials have called a sitting U.S. Representative a liar after he went on national television claiming ISIS militants were crossing into the country through the Mexican border.

The Department of Homeland Security told AOL News that Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) was telling a tale Tuesday afternoon when he told Fox News that insurgents were traversing the Texas border.

""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" spokesperson Marsha Catron told AOL.

""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

Catron's comments came one day after Hunter ranted to host Greta van Susteren about America's pourous southern border.

""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" Hunter insisted. ""They aren't flying B-1 Bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.

""At least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,"" Hunter added. ""There's nobody taking about it.""

When asked where he got the information, Hunter shot back that he ""asked the Border Patrol.""

An AOL News attempt to reach Texas Border Patrol officials was not successful. The inquiry was directed to the DHS.

""They caught them at the border,"" Hunter continued. ""Therefore, we know ISIS is coming across the border.

""If they catch five or 10 of them you know there are going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

Hunter's constituency mainly covers the San Diego area. He did not say if terrorists were also running through his neck of the woods.

When offered the opportunity to respond to DHS comments, a spokesperson for Rep Hunter provided AOL News a link to a blog claiming sources told it four ISIS terrorists have recently been arrested at the border.

Republican Duncan Hunter told a Fox News Channel audience on Tuesday that ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, is actively infiltrating the U.S.

'I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,' he said. 'There's nobody talking about it.'

But DHS fired back, saying in a statement that Hunter's claim is 'categorically false.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Rep. Duncan Hunter stunned a Fox News audience by saying that the US has apprehended about ten ISIS terrorists as they entered the country through the Mexican border

Vulnerable: Much of the Texas-Mexico border is essentially undefended, with US Border Patrol agents setting up well on the American side

'The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,' a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement, using the administration's preferred alternative acronym for the group.

'DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.'

CBS News reported Wednesday that one of Hunter's sources 'nuanced their claims' after the Fox broadcast, saying that some of the people he referred to may have been 'ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army.'

The FSA is an ISIS foe, not an ally.

Hunter's spokesman pushed back, defending his claim.

“The congressman was conveying what he knows – and what he was told,' the spokesperson said in a statement.

'It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing – it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.'

Hunter, like many in the GOP, has advocated in the past for strengthening America's border security to the south, a demand that has largely fallen on deaf ears during the Obama presidency.

During a 2013 Senate hearing, then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that due to the administration's 'significant progress and efforts ... our borders have, in fact, never been stronger.'

But Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, claimed Tuesday that the nation's 1,933-mile southern border represents ISIS's best hope of waging war on the U.S.

'If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border,' he said. 'It's that simple.'

'ISIS doesn't have a navy, they don't have an air force, they don't have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming in through the southern border – which they already have.'

'You're talking about OUR southern border?' Fox host Greta can Susteren was shocked to hear Hunter's claim that ISIS is infiltrating the US

Host Greta Van Susteren was caught flat-footed. 'Are you talking about ours?' she asked. 'You're talking about our southern border? You're not talking about the southern border of Iraq?'

'They aren't flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,' he replied, 'but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.'

The three-term congressman cited a similar fear that Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey expressed during an August 21 Pentagon press briefing.

Dempsey called ISIS 'an immediate threat ... because of open borders and immigration issues.'

Hunter said his information came directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has a 20,000-strong army of agents patrolling the borders in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California.

'I've asked the border patrol,' he said, adding that he was told about the ten ISIS fighters who were caught crossing the border.

'If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,' he said. 'But that's how you know: All you have to do is ask the border patrol.'

The government watchdog group Judicial Watch claimed in August that ISIS terrorists were 'planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.'

The group said a 'warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack' had been issued to 'agents across a number of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense agencies,'instructing them 'to aggressively work all possible leads and sources' to prevent the attacks.

The Department of Homeland Security flatly denied that in a statement to MailOnline.

'We are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim,' a bewildered DHS spokesman said

'In Mexico? I haven't seen that at all.'

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on the same day Judicial Watch made its claims that his agency and the FBI were 'unaware of any specific, credible threat to the U.S. homeland' from the terror network.","1"
"Jeh Johnson: Politicians Shouldn't 'Feed The Flames Of Fear' Over ISIS, Ebola","WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson shot down claims on Thursday that a ""porous"" U.S. southern border is allowing terrorists, Ebola and a surge of unaccompanied minors into the country, despite claims to the contrary by some politicians.

Johnson tried to dispel rumors and dial back fears during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saying there have been improvements to border security. He said the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended in fiscal year 2014 was 68,434 -- considerably lower than a projection of 90,000. Claims that four terrorists had crossed the border were false, he said, and the government is intensifying efforts to keep Ebola out of the U.S.

But that's not always what people are hearing from politicians or reading in the news, he said.

""Those of us in public office, and in the media –- whether in describing the border, ISIL or Ebola -- owe the public informed, careful, and responsible dialogue, not overheated rhetoric that is certain to feed the flames of fear, anxiety and suspicion,"" Johnson said. ISIL, the terrorist group that calls itself the Islamic State, also is called ISIS.

Recent criticism of the Obama administration over border security has stoked fears over ISIS and Ebola, particularly by Republicans campaigning for November elections. Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), now running for Senate in New Hampshire, said on Thursday that the border needed to be secured to prevent the spread of diseases into the country. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said Tuesday that ""at least"" 10 members of the Islamic State were apprehended crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, a claim DHS said was false. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has said that four men with ties to terrorism were apprehended along the border.

Johnson said the four individuals were investigated and found to be members of the Kurdish Worker's Party, which he said ""is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq."" The men remain in detention for unlawful entry, he said. (Chaffetz, for his part, continued to maintain after Johnson's speech that the men are terrorists, according to interview with CBS News.)

On Ebola, Johnson said the government is ""heavily engaged"" and is ""enhancing our Ebola screening of air passengers from the three affected African countries, and we are continually evaluating whether more is appropriate.""

""We very definitely in this country have the capability to deal with the Ebola virus,"" he said.

Johnson touted border security improvements, but said DHS was still working to improve policies on transparency and internal agency coordination. One change in DHS policy, however, has been receiving considerable pushback from immigration advocates: the increased practice of holding families in detention. The government has expanded facilities for detaining families -- largely mothers with children, many of them seeking asylum -- over the past few months, and plans to add more space.

Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which has been critical of family detention, asked Johnson during a question and answer period after the speech why the government is expanding family detention when many of the women and children being held are seeking asylum and have fled horrific violence.

Johnson said that given the increase this year in families crossing the border -- even though the numbers have dropped recently -- DHS needed to make sure it could detain them.

""We believe it's necessary to build more of that capability in the event we have another spike like we had last summer,"" he said.

Although Johnson acknowledged the influx of migrants over the past year was a ""setback,"" he said there have been improvements in border security, from more resources focused on patrol to fewer border-crossings.

""In recent years, the total number of those who attempt to cross our southwest border has declined dramatically, while the percentage of those who are apprehended has gone up,"" he said. ""Put simply, it’s now much harder to cross our border and evade capture than it used to be -– and people know that.""","1"
"ISIS Border Crisis: DHS Chief Says Terrorists Not Entering US Through Mexico","Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says Islamic State militants are not entering the U.S. through the southern border. Johnson was responding to a claim made by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., that at least 10 Islamic State operatives were detained trying to come in from Mexico.

“We have no credible, specific intelligence to that effect,” Johnson said on CNN Wednesday evening of the militants also known as ISIS. “And I look at the intelligence reports from overseas from our southern border from our intelligence community virtually every day, numerous times a day, to be on the lookout for something of that nature. So, what I’d say to the American public is we’re vigilant in looking out for individuals of suspicion who may be crossing our border.”

Johnson never mentioned Hunter by name, but he has called on lawmakers to act responsibly and not frighten Americans. “Let’s not unduly create fear and anxiety in the American public by passing on speculation and rumor,” Johnson said.

The group Judicial Watch reported late Wednesday that four “Islamic terrorists” had been seized along the southern border within 36 hours. Hunter said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday that ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""","1"

Representative Duncan Hunter (R-CA) told Fox News’ Greta van Susteren Tuesday that “at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” saying he received the information from a border patrol source.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, which has been rebutting similar claims for weeks, that’s bogus.

One of Hunter’s sources modified the claim after the congressman’s comments, saying that those apprehended might be ISIS-affiliated or even American who fought with the Syrian Free Army, one of ISIS’ many enemies.

"No, Islamic State Militants Have Not Been Caught by U.S. Border Patrol","Since the U.S. began airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State, Republicans have frequently connected the terrorist group to border security in the U.S. In August, Texas Governor Rick Perry called it a “very real possibility” that fighters from the Islamic State had already crossed into the U.S.

On Tuesday night, Representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California, took those comments even further. Appearing on ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren,"" Hunter said, “At least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the border in Texas.” When Van Susteren asked how he knew that, Hunter replied, “Because I’ve asked the border patrol, Greta.”



I asked the Department of Homeland Security if Hunter’s comments were true. They weren't.

"Homeland Security: No ISIL fighters on U.S. border","Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is pushing back against a claim made by Rep. Duncan Hunter that at least 10 Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant fighters were apprehended trying to come into the U.S. from Mexico.

“We have no credible, specific intelligence to that effect,” Johnson said of ISIL insurgents illegally entering the country from along the southern border on CNN Wednesday evening. “And I look at the intelligence reports from overseas from our southern border from our intelligence community virtually every day, numerous times a day, to be on the lookout for something of that nature. So, what I’d say to the American public is we’re vigilant in looking out for individuals of suspicion who may be crossing our border.”

The top DHS official didn’t mention Hunter, a California Republican congressman, by name. But on several occasions, Johnson said that public officials have a “responsibility” to not “unnecessarily frighten the American public.”

“Let’s not unduly create fear and anxiety in the American public by passing on speculation and rumor,” the secretary told host Wolf Blitzer.

Blitzer asked specifically about comments made Tuesday evening by Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee. “[A]t least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” the congressman said during an interview on Fox News, citing information from source from Customs and Border Protection, which is under DHS authority. Hunter also suggested that it was likely that “dozens” of others linked to the terrorist group that has recently beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers would likely not get caught by border agents and make their way into the U.S.

On Wednesday, DHS flatly said that Hunter’s claim was unfounded. “The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesperson said.

Judicial Watch reported later Wednesday that four “Islamic terrorists” had been seized along the southern border in 36 hours.

Hunter’s deputy chief of staff, Joe Kasper, told POLITICO that the congressman stands by his statement, which came from a conversation with a “high-level” source, but didn’t elaborate when asked about the individuals’ specific ties to ISIL.

In September, Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah claimed that four men linked to terrorist organizations tried to cross the border earlier that month.","1"
"Pants on Fire: Duncan Hunter makes unconfirmed claim Border Patrol caught at least 10 ISIS fighters","U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter this week declared terrorists have been crossing the Rio Grande.

The California Republican, speaking to Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Oct. 7, 2014, said he’d learned from the U.S. Border Patrol that Islamic State fighters had been nabbed trying to enter the country from Mexico. ""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" Hunter said, adding a moment later: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""

Border Patrol agents ""caught them,"" Hunter also said, but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

Our eyebrows were raised. We sought detail.

No federal or state confirmation

No state or federal law enforcement agency confirmed Hunter’s account when we inquired, and Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper declined to reveal the congressman’s sources.

Fox News, in its original Oct. 8, 2014, online news report on Hunter’s declaration, quoted the Department of Homeland Security disputing his account.

Homeland Security told PolitiFact Texas that no such apprehensions have occurred. An agency spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, emailed: ""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

And after Hunter spoke, the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote state legislators, saying in an Oct. 8, 2014, email it ""does not have any information to confirm"" statements about Islamic terrorists or ISIS fighters entering the country. A DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, confirmed the message’s authenticity.

In the message, a DPS deputy director, Robert Bodisch, mentioned the Hunter interview and an Oct. 8, 2014, news report by Judicial Watch, a conservative news website, stating Islamic terrorists had entered the country from Mexico. According to unidentified Homeland Security sources, Judicial Watch said four terrorists had been apprehended in the previous 36 hours by federal authorities and the DPS in McAllen and Pharr.

In the message to legislators, Bodisch further wrote: ""An unsecure border is certainly a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds, and it would be naïve to rule out the possibility that any criminal organization would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international border. That said, DPS does not have any information to confirm the specific statements recently reported in the press.""

On Sept. 17, 2014, PolitiFact in Washington analyzed an August 2014 Judicial Watch story, finding Mostly False another congressman’s claim that ""we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez,"" which neighbors El Paso. Research did not turn up any law enforcement official or news outlet that independently verified or corroborated the claim, making the declaration that ""we know"" with certainty ISIS is in Juarez a big stretch.

For this fact check, a terrorism expert said Hunter’s claim doesn’t make much sense.

""It’s implausible given the way the criminal-justice system works to have 10 ISIS fighters arrested at the border and never charged,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.

Gartenstein-Ross said by phone he knows of ""no reporting coming through DHS suggesting that a large number of ISIS fighters have been intercepted at the border. I’ve talked to a large number of people within the department, and the department has unequivocally denied it. There’s not one shred of evidence this is the case.""

Kasper, informed we'd not confirmed Hunter's statement, said Hunter stands by what he said.

Kasper also expressed doubt federal agencies are revealing the facts about fighters getting caught.

""Problem here is that this is always a zero-sum game,"" Kasper wrote. ""We make the point. Official channels deny. Then, maybe in a few years from now the information will pop up on the front page of the Washington Post,""  much like that newspaper this week reported new details about the Secret Service prostitution scandal, Kasper said.

Our ruling

Hunter said ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas"" and there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

No government agency confirms anything remotely close to the idea that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border. Notably, too, the lead Texas agency entrusted with public safety alerted legislators of its own lack of confirmation. Similarly, the idea there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol"" is missing a factual basis.

All told, this statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

"Islamic State Leader al-Baghdadi “Not Dead”","The Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has not been killed as has been previously claimed. He is wounded and being treated in the border area of Iraq and Syria.

A few days ago, it was reported that al-Baghdadi had been killed by a U.S. airstrike near Mosul in Northern Iraq, an attack that left three other senior members of the militant group dead.

However, a source told Iraqi media that the IS leader and self-proclaimed Caliph has not been killed, but is badly injured as a result of the recent US airstrikes near the Tel Afer and Sinjar areas.

“This is the second time al-Baghdadi has been injured in the last two months and right now he is being treated in a Syrian location close to the Iraqi border,” the source told Iraqi newspaper al-Sabah.

When it was reported that al-Baghdadi had been killed, the Pentagon did not confirm the death, but thousands of social media users shared an unverified photo claiming to be the ISIS leader’s body.

However, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren did later say that any IS leaders “inside troop formations are likely to be killed.”","1"

"Pentagon Denies It Killed ISIS Chief As Airstrikes Hit Top Extremists","The right-hand man of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was killed by an airstrike in Mosul.
An airstrike in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul killed at least two members of the group, including an aide to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, according to the Iraqi Defense Ministry.
Reports that Baghdadi himself had been killed by a U.S. airstrike circulated in Turkish and Kurdish media Wednesday and were repeated to The Daily Beast by multiple Iraqi sources. But a Pentagon official denied that the ISIS leader was dead. ""There is no validity to the rumor that we've killed Baghdadi,"" a senior defense official told The Daily Beast.  

The Iraqi Defense Ministry announcement, first reported by al Arabayia, did not specify whether the airstrike was carried out by American or Iraqi forces, but NBC News reports that a senior security official confirmed it was a U.S. airstrike. The article does not clarify whether the security official is American or Iraqi but quotes them as saying that three ISIS leaders were killed, including Baghdadi’s aide Abu Hajar Al-Sufi, an explosives specialist and commander in the town of Tal Afar.

There have been no public statements yet from U.S. officials on the reported airstrikes.

While the U.S. air war in Iraq has been steadily expanding since it began in early August, Thursday’s reports provide the first public indication that ISIS’s senior leadership is being directly targeted.

The rumors of Baghdadi’s death that spread through northern Iraq yesterday may have been triggered by uncertainty over who died in the airstrikes that reportedly killed his aide. It’s also possible that claim’s of Baghdadi’s death could have come from ISIS itself as part of a deception campaign to cover the leader’s tracks and obscure his true status and whereabouts.

Multiple sources, including Kurdish intelligence officials and former Iraqi army officers, told The Daily Beast Wednesday that Baghdadi had died somewhere in Syria after being wounded in a recent airstrike and fleeing Iraq to seek medical treatment.

This was not the first time that rumors of Baghdadi’s death have surfaced. Without an independent press to verify new information, unverified claims can be spread quickly through Iraq as speculation outpacing facts and gets taken for the truth.

But the new reports that ISIS leaders were killed by airstrikes in Mosul, coming only a day after a flurry of claims about Baghdadi’s death in Syria, suggests the group’s leadership is increasingly vulnerable and that Baghdadi may be on the run and seeking sanctuary in Syria where President Obama has not yet authorized military intervention.

"‘Photo of slain IS leader’ reported to be doctored","A photo purporting to show the slain body of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appears to be a doctored picture of another slain militant killed in Syria in 2013.
Rumors circulated on social media and Iraqi media over the weekend that Baghdadi was slain in a US airstrike several days ago.
Later Iraqi reports said the IS leader was severely wounded in the chest near the Syrian border and was receiving medical treatment.

The reports could not be independently confirmed.

A picture purporting to show Baghdadi’s bloodied body in fatigues also circulated.

However, the picture appears to actually show Baghdadi’s head pasted onto the body of Sami Hafez Al-Abdullah, an Albanian national killed in Syria in 2013, according to an investigation by Storyful, a social media news agency.
A picture of Abdullah, who reportedly also served as an imam in Germany, and a report on his death appeared on Yemenite news site Hournews.net last year.

Despite the apparently doctored photo, Baghdadi’s fate, amid continuing American air strikes, remains unclear. 

Washington expanded its month-long air campaign to Iraq’s Sunni Arab heartland, hitting Islamic State fighters west of Baghdad as troops and allied tribesmen launched a ground assault on Sunday.

The new strikes deepen Washington’s involvement in the conflict and were a significant escalation for President Barack Obama, who made his political career opposing the war in Iraq and pulled out US troops in 2011.

Previous strikes — since the US air campaign began on August 8 — had been mainly in support of Kurdish forces in the north.

US warplanes bombed IS fighters around a strategic dam on the Euphrates River in an area that the jihadists have repeatedly tried to capture from government troops and their Sunni militia allies.

“We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam, which remains under control of Iraqi security forces, with support from Sunni tribes,” Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said.

“The potential loss of control of the dam, or a catastrophic failure of the dam — and the flooding that might result — would have threatened US personnel and facilities in and around Baghdad, as well as thousands of Iraqi citizens,” he added.

"Video Appears to Show Beheading of Journalist James Foley, Who Went Missing in Syria","A disturbing video posted online appears to show the beheading of American journalist James Foley, who was kidnapped while covering the Syrian conflict in 2012.

In the video a man who appears to be Foley, dressed in orange, kneels beside an armed man clad in black. Foley delivers a statement condemning U.S. action in Iraq and says that the U.S. government is his “real killers.”

“For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” Foley says in halting speech. “I wish I had more time. I wish I could have the hope of freedom of seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.”

Seconds later, the figure dressed in black brandishes a knife and identifies himself as with the Islamic State, the name the brutal terror group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria took on after its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared himself the leader of all Muslims.

“Today your military air force has attacked us daily… Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims,” the figure in black says. He then addresses President Obama directly, saying “any attempt… to deny the Muslims their right to live in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.”

Foley is then killed. The video continues, showing American Steven Sotloff, who has written for national publications like Time, also dressed in orange and on his knees.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the figure in black says.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the U.S. intelligence community ""is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity.""

""If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,"" spokesperson Caitlin Hayden wrote in a statement to reporters.

The U.S. government offers a $10 million reward for information leading to ISIS leader al-Baghdadi’s capture.

Foley was on assignment in Syria for the news outlet GlobalPost. The news organization's co-founder Charles Sennott said today there is ""no reliable proof that this execution is authentic"" and that they're working to gather information.

""If the video is verified, it is just unfathomable darkness to think that a life as bright as Jim Foley's ended that way,"" Sennott said. ""He was an experienced and fearless journalist who believed deeply in reporting from the frontlines.""

In an interview with The Boston Globe in 2011, Foley spoke about being held captive while covering the uprising in Libya and the importance of his job.

“I believe that frontline journalism is important,” Foley said. “Without these photos and videos and firsthand experience, we really can’t tell the world how bad it might be.”

Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., had worked with Foley's family and the State Department in their efforts to get Foley back.

It will also confront the potentially necessary step of pursuing the Islamic State in Syria, where President Barack Obama has resisted launching airstrikes or deploying significant American firepower.

Obama was expected to make a statement Wednesday about Foley's killing.

U.S. officials confirmed a grisly video released Tuesday showing Islamic State militants beheading Foley. Separately, Foley's family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a Facebook page that was created to rally support for his release, saying they ""have never been prouder of him.""

""He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" said the statement, which was attributed to Foley's mother, Diane Foley. She implored the militants to spare the lives of other hostages. ""Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.""

Foley, 40, from Rochester, New Hampshire, went missing in northern Syria in November 2012 while freelancing for Agence France-Presse and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control. He had not been heard from since.

The beheading marks the first time the Islamic State has killed an American citizen since the Syrian conflict broke out in March 2011, upping the stakes in an increasingly chaotic and multilayered war. The killing is likely to complicate U.S. involvement in Iraq and the Obama administration's efforts to contain the group as it expands in both Iraq and Syria.

The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al-Qaida in Iraq, which beheaded many of its victims, including American businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004.

The video released on websites Tuesday appears to show the increasing sophistication of the Islamic State group's media unit and begins with scenes of Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes.

It then cuts to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert, next to a black-clad militant with a knife to his throat. Foley's name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen. After the captive speaks, the masked man is shown apparently beginning to cut at his neck; the video fades to black before the beheading is completed. The next shot appears to show the captive lying dead on the ground, his head on his body. The video appears to have been shot in an arid area; there is no vegetation to be seen and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray-blue sky.

At the end of the video, a militant shows a second man, who was identified as another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, and warns that he could be the next captive killed. Sotloff was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border in August 2013; he had freelanced for Time, the National Interest and MediaLine.

One U.S. official said the video appeared to be authentic, and two other U.S. officials said the victim was Foley. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the killing by name.

Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the past two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.

Both areas are in northern Iraq, which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria.

Since Aug. 8, the U.S. military has struck at least 70 Islamic State targets — including security checkpoints, vehicles and weapons caches. It's not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes, although it's likely that some were.

The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al-Qaida's leaders. In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control, the extremists have slain soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying ways — including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria, and has not released their nationalities. In its annual report in November, the committee concluded that the missing journalists were either being held and threatened with death by extremists, or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom. The group's report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives' release.

"Obama: US Won't Stop Confronting Islamic state","The United States stood firm Wednesday in its fight with Islamic State militants who beheaded a U.S. journalist in Iraq, pledging to continue attacking the group despite its threats to kill another American hostage. The U.S. military continued its airstrikes against the group as President Barack Obama denounced the group as a ""cancer"" threatening the entire region.

""We will be vigilant and we will be relentless,"" Obama said.

Calling for a global response to the group that now controls territory in both Iraq and Syria, Obama condemned the group's execution of journalist James Foley, whose death he said had left the nation heartbroken. In forceful remarks, Obama accused the Islamic State of torturing, raping and murdering thousands of people in ""cowardly acts of violence.""

""ISIL speaks for no religion,"" Obama said, using an alternative name for the Islamic State. ""Their victims are overwhelmingly Muslim, and no faith teaches people to massacre innocents. No just god would stand for what they did yesterday and what they do every single day.""

Obama's remarks affirmed that the U.S. would not change its military posture in Iraq in response to Foley's killing. Since the video was released Tuesday, the U.S. military has pressed ahead by conducting nearly a dozen airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq.

The president said he'd told Foley's family in a phone call Wednesday that the United States joins them in honoring all that Foley did, praising the journalist for his work telling the story of the crisis in Syria, where Foley was captured in 2012. ""Jim Foley's life stands in stark contrast to his killers,"" Obama said. He spoke from Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where the president is on vacation.

Foley, 40, from Rochester, New Hampshire, went missing in northern Syria in November 2012 while freelancing for Agence France-Presse and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control. He had not been heard from since.

"ISIS Beheads American Journalist James Foley in Video Message to U.S.","ISIS militants released gruesome video footage this afternoon of the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley as a message to the U.S. to stop intervening in Iraq. Foley, a freelancer who contributed to the Global Post, was first captured in Libya in 2012, released, and then kidnapped again around Thanksgiving 2012 by unidentified gunmen in Syria. He was 39 years old.

The (extremely disturbing) video can be viewed here. @Mujahid4life tweeted stills from it, which are (aside from the one below), sickeningly graphic.

The Global Post reported the circumstances of his disappearance last year, after attempting to keep the news quiet for fear of Foley's safety:

Foley had set off toward the border in a car about an hour before his capture. A witness, a Syrian, later recounted over the phone to a journalist in Turkey that an unmarked car intercepted Foley. The witness said men holding kalashnikovs shot into the air and forced Jim out of the car.

The witness said he noticed nothing that would indicate whether the aggressors were rebel fighters, individuals looking for a ransom, members of a pro-government militia, or a religious-based group with other motivations.
He was held captive for 635 days.

In 2013, Foley's family set up a Find James Foley website for him, which states that he's the oldest of five children. His friend, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote about him for Syria Deeply last year:

Jim sees the good in nearly everything and everyone. He is a master motivator. ""You got this, dude!"" he'll say. ""That story's great, just file it already."" ...

Everybody, everywhere, takes a liking to Jim as soon as they meet him.","1"
"Islamic Militants Post Video Claiming to Show Beheading of U.S. Journalist","Editors' note: There are images in this post that some readers may find distressing.

Islamic State militants on Tuesday released a video that purported to show the beheading of James Foley, an American freelance journalist who has been missing since he was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012.

The authenticity of the video could not be immediately verified.

When contacted by Mashable, NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said, “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

The video opens with a clip of President Barack Obama's remarks announcing the launch of airstrikes on Islamic State positions near Erbil in northern Iraq. A black screen then shows the text, ""A message to America,"" and then Foley appears kneeling in a desert landscape, wearing an orange jumpsuit with a microphone attached. A hooded man wearing all-black clothes and tan military boots is standing behind him with a gun in a leather holster.

""I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,"" Foley says, among other things, in remarks seemingly prepared for him by his captors.

The video then switches to the man in black, who is now holding a serrated knife.

""This is James Wright Foley — an American citizen of your country,"" the man says in British-accented English. ""As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards Islamic State.... Effectively, any aggression towards the Islamic State is an aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership. So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the safety of Muslims living under the safety of the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

The man then beheads Foley, using the knife as the video fades to black. After a shot of Foley's lifeless body and decapitated head, the video switches to the executioner now standing behind another man in an orange jumpsuit, identified in text on the screen as Steven Joel Sotloff.

""The life of this American prisoner, Obama, depends on your next decision.""

Sotloff, an American freelance journalist who had been working for Time magazine among other publications, was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border on Aug. 4, 2013.

The video then goes black.

The video was first reported by Zaid Benjamin, a reporter for the Arabic-language Radio Sawa, who said that it came from Furqan Media, the official outlet for the Islamic State. (Twitter suspended — then reinstated — the account.)

The video appeared to surface first on the Twitter account @mujahid4life, belonging to someone who described himself in his Twitter bio as 19 years old, ""anti-democracy. Loyal to the Caliphate. Harsh on kuffar. #Revert""

It didn't take long before people who had worked with Foley began reacting on Twitter.

I was w/ James Foley in Aleppo, August 2012 for a day in #Selahaddin. Syrian opposition members were adoring him. He was a kind, brave man

— ilhan tanir (@WashingtonPoint) August 19, 2014

My thoughts are with James Foley’s family. No matter what he faced, he was unfailingly kind, generous, and warm. A wonderful soul.

— Max Fisher (@Max_Fisher) August 19, 2014

There was also anger on Twitter that YouTube didn't immediately take down the video.

It's lucky that video didn't have a unlicensed Katy Perry song as a soundtrack or it would've been deleted from YouTube in seconds.

— Tom Gara (@tomgara) August 19, 2014

However, within an hour of the first report of the beheading, the video was taken down.

Images from the video are below, showing Foley before his execution and Sotloff being threatened:

Shortly after the clip appeared on the web, journalists and observers who watch the region began tweeting a hashtag — #ISISmediaBlackout — pledging to stop sharing Islamic State propaganda.

""You know what I think? And I know how crazy this sounds, but we need an #ISISmediaBlackout. Amputate their reach. Pour water on their flame,"" said a Tumblr blogger known as LibyaLiberty on Twitter in what appeared to be the first mention of the hashtag. ""From here on out, I won't share any photo or video of violence intentionally recorded & released by ISIS for propaganda,"" she tweeted. Many others, promptly, joined her pledge.

A statement from a group called Free James Foley said: ""We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.""

Post by Free James Foley.

Foley's parents appeared on the Today show last year, pleading for his release.

UPDATED 8:28 p.m. ET: GlobalPost CEO Philip Balboni released a statement Tuesday about the video that purportedly shows the beheading of journalist James Foley.

""On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim’s possible execution first broke. We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic,"" Balboni said.

“Although GlobalPost’s investigation at one point led us to believe that James was being held by the Syrian government, we later were given strong reason to believe he was being held by Islamic rebels in Syria,"" he added. ""We withheld this information at the request of the family and on the advice of authorities cooperating in the effort to protect Jim. GlobalPost, working with a private security company, has amassed an enormous amount of information that has not been made public.”

Foley reported in Syria for GlobalPost as a freelancer.

"Islamic State claims to have beheaded American journalist","Bloodthirsty militants in Iraq released a horrific video on Tuesday that shows the apparent beheading of American journalist James Wright Foley — with the execution aimed at forcing President Obama to put an end to US airstrikes.

Foley, a 40-year-old photojournalist kidnapped in 2012, was forced to recite anti-American hatred from his Islamic State in Iraq and Syria captors as his final words before a masked killer put the knife to his neck.

The video — which was posted on YouTube until the site yanked it down — shows Foley dressed in prisoner orange and on his knees in the desert area. His head is shaved. Behind him is a man covered head to toe in black. It’s titled “A Message to America.”

“Any attempt by you, Obama, to deny Muslims liberty and safety under the Islamic caliphate, will result in the bloodshed of your people,” an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorist says in reference to US airstrikes in Iraq.

A stone-faced Foley — who was last seen on Thanksgiving 2012 while working for Agence France-Presse — then bravely reads a clearly coerced statement.

“I call on my friends family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government. My message to my beloved parents: Save me some dignity and don’t accept any meager compensation for my death from the same people who effectively put the last nail in my coffin,” he said.

“I call on my brother who is in the Air Force. I call on you, John. Think about who made the decision to bomb Iraq. Who did they really kill? Did they think about me you and our family when they made that decision? I died that day, John. When your colleagues dropped that bomb, they signed my death certificate. I wish I had more time. I wish I had the hope of seeing my family one more time.”

As a final insult, his last forced words were, “I guess all-in-all I wish I wasn’t American.”

The video then shows another American — Time journalist Steven Joel Sotloff — and the group says he is next unless the US backs off.

He is being held by the collar as he kneels in the desert, also wearing prisoner orange and a shaved head.

Sotloff was abducted in Syria in August 2013. His last Tweet was about his hometown Miami Heat.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the masked man says.

White House National Security Council Spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said they’re analyzing the video of the beheading to determine its authenticity.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said.

ISIS had warned the US of the potential murder in an earlier video saying, “We will drown all of you in blood” in retaliation for US airstrikes that have been pounding them.

Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge crushing airstrikes over the last two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.

US Rep. Peter King (R-NY) said the video reveals ISIS for the true murders they are.

“ISIS is the worst of the worst,” King said. “These guys are truly animals.… We have to go after them and destroy them.”

Foley family friend Holly Rene, who lives in their hometown of Rochester, NH, told The Post, “These savages have got to be stopped. It’s coming West.”

She said the family is “falling apart with grief.

“I was just so hopeful Jimmy had, if they weren’t going to get any good news, that he would have been dead for a long time now and there was no suffering involved. And to think he went through two years just to have this ending, it’s beyond belief.”

Foley’s family had set up website to plead for Foley’s return — and urged patience on Tuesday.

“We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers,” the Find James Foley Facebook wrote: “Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

Foley, one of five children, had been captured previously in Libya for 45 days in 2011.

He graduated from Marquette University in 1996 and later studied journalism at Northwestern University.

He penned a letter to Marquette Magazine thanking the community for its prayers when he was captured in Tripoli with two colleagues. He recounted getting to call his mother from prison and learning of the university’s prayer vigil for his release.

“If nothing else, prayer was the glue that enabled my freedom, an inner freedom first and later the miracle of being released during a war in which the regime had no real incentive to free us,” Foley wrote. “It didn’t make sense, but faith did.”","1"
"Mom’s loving tribute to reporter son murdered by jihadi savages","Bloodthirsty militants in Iraq released a horrific video Tuesday that shows the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley — with the execution aimed at forcing President Obama to end US airstrikes.

Foley, 40, who was kidnapped in Syria nearly two years ago, was forced to recite anti-American hatred before a masked Islamic State killer put the knife to his neck.

The video — posted on YouTube before being yanked — shows Foley dressed in prisoner orange and on his knees in the desert. His head is shaved. Behind him is his knife-wielding killer, covered from head to toe in black. Its title is “A Message to America.”

“Any attempt by you, Obama, to deny Muslims liberty and safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people,” the terrorist says in reference to US airstrikes against the Islamic State.

Foley — last seen on Thanksgiving 2012 while working for Agence France-Presse — earlier reads a clearly coerced statement.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government. My message to my beloved parents: Save me some dignity and don’t accept any meager compensation for my death from the same people who effectively put the last nail in my coffin,” he says.

“I call on my brother, who is in the Air Force. I call on you, John. Think about who made the decision to bomb Iraq. Who did they really kill? Did they think about me, you and our family when they made that decision? I died that day, John. When your colleagues dropped that bomb, they signed my death certificate. I wish I had more time. I wish I had the hope of seeing my family one more time.”

As a final insult, his last forced words were, “I guess, all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.”

The video then cuts to a gruesome image of Foley’s blood-soaked head, detached from his body and resting on his back near his shackled hands.

The militants then display another kneeling and shackled American — Time journalist Steven Joel Sotloff — and the group says he is next unless the United States backs off.

Sotloff was abducted in Syria in August 2013.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the masked man says.

In a statement posted on a Facebook page affiliated with the Foley family, James’ mother, Diane, said, “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.

“We thank Jim for all the joy he gave us. He was an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person.”

She also called for an end to Islamic State brutality, saying: “We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents.”

Obama was briefed on Foley’s barbaric murder while flying on Air Force One to Martha’s Vineyard to resume his vacation.

Two US officials said they believe the video is authentic, although White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said US intelligence is still analyzing it.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said.

The Washington Post reported that European officials were going over the video to compare the voice of the executioner — who seemed to have a trace of a British accent — with ex-Guantanamo Bay inmates who had British ties.

The Islamic State — also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS — had warned the United States of the potential murder in an earlier video, saying, “We will drown all of you in blood” in revenge.

Senior US officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the airstrikes that freed ethnic Yazidis who had been trapped by the terrorists on Mount Sinjar, and that helped Kurds retake the crucial Mosul dam from the Islamic State.

Foley family friend Holly Rene, who lives in their hometown of Rochester, NH, told The Post, “These savages have got to be stopped. It’s coming West.”

She said the family is “falling apart with grief.”

Foley, one of five children, had been a hostage before, having been held in Libya for 45 days in 2011.

He graduated from Marquette University in 1996 and later studied journalism at Northwestern.

He penned a letter to Marquette Magazine thanking the community for its prayers when he was captured in Tripoli with two colleagues.

“If nothing else, prayer was the glue that enabled my freedom, an inner freedom first and later the miracle of being released during a war in which the regime had no real incentive to free us,” Foley wrote. “It didn’t make sense, but faith did.”","1"
"Jihadi savages: Captured Time journalist is next","Bloodthirsty militants in Iraq released a horrific video Tuesday that shows the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley — with the execution aimed at forcing President Obama to end US airstrikes.

Foley, 40, who was kidnapped in Syria nearly two years ago, was forced to recite anti-American hatred before a masked Islamic State killer put the knife to his neck.

The video — posted on YouTube before being yanked — shows Foley dressed in prisoner orange and on his knees in the desert. His head is shaved. Behind him is his knife-wielding killer, covered from head to toe in black. Its title is “A Message to America.”

“Any attempt by you, Obama, to deny Muslims liberty and safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people,” the terrorist says in reference to US airstrikes against the Islamic State.

Foley — last seen on Thanksgiving 2012 while working for Agence France-Presse — earlier reads a clearly coerced statement.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government. My message to my beloved parents: Save me some dignity and don’t accept any meager compensation for my death from the same people who effectively put the last nail in my coffin,” he says.

“I call on my brother, who is in the Air Force. I call on you, John. Think about who made the decision to bomb Iraq. Who did they really kill? Did they think about me, you and our family when they made that decision? I died that day, John. When your colleagues dropped that bomb, they signed my death certificate. I wish I had more time. I wish I had the hope of seeing my family one more time.”

As a final insult, his last forced words were, “I guess, all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.”

The video then cuts to a gruesome image of Foley’s blood-soaked head, detached from his body and resting on his back near his shackled hands.

The militants then display another kneeling and shackled American — Time journalist Steven Joel Sotloff — and the group says he is next unless the United States backs off.

Sotloff was abducted in Syria in August 2013.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the masked man says.

In a statement posted on a Facebook page affiliated with the Foley family, James’ mother, Diane, said, “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.

“We thank Jim for all the joy he gave us. He was an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person.”

She also called for an end to Islamic State brutality, saying: “We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents.”

Obama was briefed on Foley’s barbaric murder while flying on Air Force One to Martha’s Vineyard to resume his vacation.

Two US officials said they believe the video is authentic, although White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said US intelligence is still analyzing it.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said.

The Washington Post reported that European officials were going over the video to compare the voice of the executioner — who seemed to have a trace of a British accent — with ex-Guantanamo Bay inmates who had British ties.

The Islamic State — also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS — had warned the United States of the potential murder in an earlier video, saying, “We will drown all of you in blood” in revenge.

Senior US officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the airstrikes that freed ethnic Yazidis who had been trapped by the terrorists on Mount Sinjar, and that helped Kurds retake the crucial Mosul dam from the Islamic State.

"Pure Evil: Islamic State Beheads American Journalist James Wright Foley","The Islamic State kidnapped American journalist James Foley on November 22, 2012.

Foley was a freelance photo journalist covering the civil war in Syria at the time.


IS has held him ever since, but today they tweeted out video of his beheading.

They want publicity from this barbaric act, and I’m loathe to give it to them even by writing a few words about it.

But their barbarity needs to be exposed.

President Obama is reluctant to do anything about the Islamic State’s spread, other than to order airstrikes. Over the past few days, those airstrikes have helped the Kurdish and Iraqi forces fight IS. Iraqi forces recaptured the strategic Mosul dam.

But IS is far from broken. They still hold Mosul and several other Iraqi and Syrian cities. They are still capturing Iraqi Christians and Yazidis and reportedly selling captured women into sex slavery. They are murdering people by the dozens, by the hundreds. IS has designs on consolidating its power in Iraq and Syria and using that as a springboard to attack the United States and Europe. Tellingly, the murderer in the IS video of Foley’s execution — which I won’t post here — has a British accent.

IS is still holding American journalist Steven Sotloff. They have tweeted photos of him kneeling in an orange jumpsuit, next to a probable executioner, and declared that his life depends on what President Obama does next.","1"
"Islamic State militants claim to behead missing American journalist","Islamic State militants have released a graphic video allegedly depicting the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley, who has been missing in Syria since 2012.

The Islamist group also threatened to kill another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff of World Affairs and Time, stating his fate is in the hands of President Barack Obama.

Foley went missing almost two years ago while covering the conflict in Syria as a freelance photographer. The 39-year-old reporter was working for Agence France-Presse when he disappeared, and his whereabouts were essentially unknown until this recording surfaced.

His November 22nd disappearance was classified as a kidnapping by the FBI, which stated he “was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria.”

In the new video, the militants proclaimed the violent act as “a message to America” for its decision to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq, where it has made rapid territorial conquests over the last few months.

After stating that President Obama’s decision to authorize military action against the extremist group “effectively [placed] America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,” Foley appears kneeling beside a masked man. He is forced to read a letter which blames the US government for “hammering the final nail into his coffin” before the masked man takes his life.
Sotloff’s life, meanwhile, “depends on Obama’s next decision,” the group claimed. Sotloff has been missing since mid-2013, and his Twitter account indicates his last known location was Libya.

In a statement, the US National Security Council confirmed it had seen the video, but added that it's still working to determine its authenticity.

""If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

The video’s release comes just one day after militants declared they would attack American targets “in any place” if American airstrikes kill any of their members. Militants said, “we will drown all of you in blood” and flashed images of an American was beheading during the United States’ initial invasion of Iraq.

So far, the Islamic State’s campaign through Iraq has seen numerous reports of beheadings, including those carried out against child victims. The group has regularly threatened Christians and other minorities to either convert to their radical take on Islam or die, and even forced tens of thousands of ethnic Yazidis to flee to Sinjar Mountain with no food or water in order to escape being executed.

The last event triggered renewed military and humanitarian action by the United States earlier this month, and airstrikes have been used to help Kurdish security forces beat back militant fighters from northern Iraq. On Monday, Obama announced Iraqi and Kurdish forces had retaken control of the Mosul Dam – Iraq’s largest, and a key strategic landmark – marking the most significant victory for Iraqi troops since the US became involved again.","1"
"Islamic State Militants Claim to Have Beheaded US Journalist James Wright Foley","Islamic State militants released a video on Tuesday purporting to show the beheading of American journalist James Wright Foley, who has been missing since he was kidnapped in northwest Syria on November 22, 2012. Foley was abducted by unknown gunmen outside a cafe in Binesh, along with his translator, who was later released.

Another captive is shown at the end of the video. He is identified as Steven Sotloff, an American journalist who has been missing since August 2013.

The video has not yet been independently verified. The video and images were released on Twitter by user @mujahid4life. The account has since been suspended.

A freelancer known for his work covering conflict in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya, Foley had contributed work to GlobalPost, Agence France-Presse, and various other outlets. In 2011, he was kidnapped and held by pro-Qaddafi forces in Libya before being released after 45 days.

""Captivity is the state most violently opposite his nature,"" his friend Clare Morgana Gillis, a journalist who had been kidnapped with him in Libya in 2011, wrote in a piece last year for Syria Deeply. ""But when we were detained in Tripoli, Jim automatically turned his energies to keeping up our strength and hope.""

In the video, the man identified as Foley delivers what appears to be a prepared statement.

""I call on my friends, family, and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government,"" he says. ""For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality.""

He goes on to decry the American aerial operation in Iraq, and ends by saying, ""I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again. But that ship has sailed. I guess all in all I wish I wasn't American.""

A masked militant attired in black stands beside him. 

""This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country,"" the militant says, brandishing a knife in his left hand. ""As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State. You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs. Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide. So effectively any aggression towards the Islamic State is an aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic caliphate as their leadership. So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

The video then shows the militant begin to cut the man's throat with the knife before fading to black, followed by a graphic image of his body.

The militant then appears standing beside the man identified as Sotloff.

""The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,"" he says.","1"
"Video Purports to Show Beheading of American Journalist","James Foley went missing in November 2012

The video, which appears to be the work of the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria, declares the act “A Message to #America (from the #IslamicState)” and retribution for the United States’ intervention against ISIS in Iraq. Some versions of the video and Twitter accounts circulating it were quickly taken offline Tuesday evening, though the video soon appeared on YouTube again.

TIME is not publishing the video. The video also includes a threat to kill Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who has written for TIME among other outlets, and has been missing since August 2013.

A Facebook page affiliated with the Foley family’s campaign for his release posted a message Tuesday saying it couldn’t confirm the authenticity of the video or Foley’s fate.

“We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers,” the post read. “Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council said the American intelligence community “is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity.”

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said. “We will provide more information when it is available.”

Updated 11:43 a.m. on Aug. 20

A video posted online Tuesday purportedly shows an Islamist extremist beheading James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in Syria more than 18 months ago.

A graphic video of the purported killing, which the U.S. government believes to be authentic, was posted online Tuesday and quickly spread on social media. The video, which appears to be the work of the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria, declares the act “A Message to #America (from the #IslamicState)” and retribution for the United States’ intervention against ISIS in Iraq. Some versions of the video and Twitter accounts circulating it were quickly taken offline Tuesday evening, though the video soon appeared on YouTube again.

TIME is not publishing the video. The video also includes a threat to kill Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who has written for TIME among other outlets, and has been missing since August 2013.

A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council said Wednesday morning the American intelligence community believes the video is authentic.

“The U.S. Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing U.S. citizens James Foley and Steven Sotloff,” said NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden. “We have reached the judgment that this video is authentic.”

A Facebook page affiliated with the Foley family’s campaign for his release posted a message Tuesday evening from his mother, Diane Foley.

“We have never been prouder of our son Jim,” she wrote. “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people…We thank Jim for all the joy he gave us. He was an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person. Please respect our privacy in the days ahead as we mourn and cherish Jim.”

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement Tuesday that President Barack Obama had been briefed on the video and “will continue to receive regular updates.”

The White House announced that Obama will deliver a statement at 12:45 p.m. Wednesday.

Foley “was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria,” near the Turkish border, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in an alert following the Nov. 22, 2012, kidnapping. He was in Binesh covering the Syrian civil war for the GlobalPost website and AFP.

"ISLAMIC STATE BEHEADS MISSING AMERICAN JOURNALIST JAMES WRIGHT FOLEY","The Islamic State released a video of its jihadists beheading American journalist James Wright Foley in Syria. The video is almost five minutes long and includes threats against President Barack Obama and the United States.
In the video, which was temporarily available on YouTube but has since been removed, the terrorists remind the audience Obama authorized military action against IS and replayed Obama’s press conference when he announced the airstrikes. To them the declaration is a “slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.”
Foley then appears on his knees in an orange jumpsuit. He relays a message that the US government is his true killer. He addresses his family as well. The message is choppy, which gives the appearance that he is reading off cards placed in front of the camera.
His executioner speaks with what appears to be a British accent, saying many Muslims worldwide accepted IS and a war against IS is, in essence, a war against Muslims. The UK has been one of the Islamic State's most active targets of recruitment.
After he beheads Foley, he presents to the camera another journalist, Steven Joel Soltoff, who worked for Time and The National Interest. Soltoff was reported missing in the middle of last year. The executioner said America’s next move will determine IS’s next move in what appears to be a threat against the second journalist.
Foley was an independent journalist in the Middle East. In 2011, he was one of four journalists kidnapped by Qaddafi’s forces in Libya, of which he said in an interview with the Boston Globe, “You don’t want to be defined as that guy who got captured in 2011... believe that front-line journalism is important.” He spoke at Northwestern University about his experience in Libya.

"ISIS Appears To Behead American Photojournalist In YouTube Video","“A Message To America,” a video uploaded Tuesday to YouTube, begins with a clip of President Obama announcing his recent authorization of targeted airstrikes and a humanitarian operation in Iraq. Then, around the two minute mark, a man believed to be James Wright Foley, 40, delivers a statement:

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers: the U.S. government,” he says, before specifically addressing his brother John, a member of the U.S. Air Force. (A full transcript of his last words was posted online by the blogger Brown Moses and can be found here.)

About two minutes and 20 seconds later, the man is apparently beheaded. His executioner, whose face is covered, has what sounds like a British accent and threatens that “any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.”

Two people who know Foley said the man in the video appears to be him, and that the voice sounds like his. A Facebook page that is part of the Foley family’s appeal to find and bring Foley home posted the following statement: “We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

Foley, a freelance photojournalist for the AFP and GlobalPost, and his translator were kidnapped in Binesh, Syria, in November 2012. According to the FBI, his translator was later released.

The propaganda video ends with a shot of another kneeling man in orange believed to be missing journalist Steven Sotloff. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the executioner says.

A version of the clip viewed by BuzzFeed was removed from YouTube after about 20 minutes, though others have been uploaded since.

“YouTube has clear policies that prohibit content like gratuitous violence, hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts, and we remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users,” a spokesperson for YouTube said. “We also terminate any account registered by a member of a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization and used in an official capacity to further its interests.”

“We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL,” said NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden. “The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

"James Foley remembered as 'brave and tireless' journalist","New York (CNN) -- When war reporter James Foley wasn't writing for GlobalPost or recording video for AFP or appearing on the PBS ""NewsHour,"" he occasionally shared stories on his own blog, aptly titled ""A World of Troubles.""

For a subtitle, he chose the famous Carl von Clausewitz sentence ""War is fought by human beings.""

And that is exactly what Foley sought to show with his reporting: humanity amid the horror of war.

Foley was abducted while on a reporting trip in northern Syria in November 2012. He was never heard from again.

A video published Tuesday by the extremist group ISIS showed Foley being beheaded. It is not known when or where the video was recorded.

For Foley's family and friends, the recording was the answer they hoped they'd never hear to their questions about his disappearance.

""We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" his mother, Diane, said Tuesday night,

She called him ""an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person.""

Courageous, generous

Foley was the oldest child of Diane and John Foley of Rochester, New Hampshire. He had four siblings.

Foley -- Jim to his friends -- had been reporting from war-torn countries for the better part of four years when he disappeared in Syria.

On Tuesday, fellow journalists remembered him for his courage and his generosity.

One of his friends, Alex Sherman of Bloomberg News, wrote on Twitter that he was a ""funny, warm, Big Lebowski-loving guy.""

Another friend, Max Fisher of Vox, praised his ""dedication to truth and understanding.""

Fisher also wrote that ""Jim's faith was something we all agreed not to discuss publicly while he was held in Syria, but it was the wellspring of his generosity,""

He recalled how Foley helped to organize a memorial fund for a photographer, Anton Hammerl, who was killed in Libya in 2011.

Foley had been traveling with Hammerl and two other journalists at the time, and the three who survived wound up in a Libyan jail.

Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors

Front-line journalist

Foley was freed six weeks later. Afterward, in a video interview with the Boston Globe, he hesitated to make the story about himself, remarking at one point that ""you don't want to be defined as 'that guy who got captured in 2011.'""

""I believe that front-line journalism is important, you know -- without these photos and videos and first-hand experience, we can't really tell the world how bad it might be,"" he said.

One of the journalists detained with Foley in Libya, Clare Morgana Gillis, said his fundraising for Hammerl's family was ""the same impulse that compelled him to cut short his much-needed break from reporting in Syria when a colleague went missing last summer, and to raise money for an ambulance for Aleppo's Dar al-Shifa field hospital, where he spent weeks filming the plight of doctors who struggled to save lives with minimal space equipment.""

His time as a teacher

For Foley, these were acts of service, not entirely unlike his time spent in the Teach for America program. He began teaching in Phoenix in 1996.

""He'd promise students that he'd take them to the Castles and Coasters amusement park if they would come to class everyday,"" a fellow Teach for America alum, Sarah Fang, recalled in an essay in 2013.

Foley later ""taught reading and writing to inmates at the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp in Chicago,"" according to a Columbia Journalism Review feature about him.

Would you watch the video?

His journalism career

In the mid-2000s he decided to pursue a journalism career, first by enrolling at Northwestern University's well-respected Medill School of Journalism and then by embedding with American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. While preparing for his first embed, he started his blog.

Foley freelanced for a number of news media outlets, including GlobalPost, a world news Web site founded in 2009.

In 2012, he gravitated toward the spiraling conflict in Syria.

Fang, who kept in touch with Foley after their years teaching in Phoenix, wrote that his interest in the story there did not surprise her.

""He's always been willing to step into a zone where no one else wants to go,"" she wrote. ""Jim feels that society needs reporters willing to bear witness and report back the facts of history-in-the-making. And his loyalty to his colleagues meant that he wanted to be there with them on the frontlines.""

BuzzFeed Middle East correspondent Sheera Frenkel said she last saw Foley about a week before his final trip into Syria.

Drinking beers at the lobby of a hotel popular among journalists, they talked, she said, about ""how hard it was to move on from this job, into a life which would allow for marriage and family.""

""He was a generous colleague, never holding back a tip, phone number, or detail that could help, and could spend hours talking over the ins and outs of a story to get it just right,"" Frenkel wrote in an email message.

""Jim was a great journalist, and I think he'd like to be remembered that way, first and foremost.""

After the news of Foley's killing spread on Tuesday, CBS News foreign correspondent Clarissa Ward changed her profile picture on Twitter to a photo of Foley wearing a helmet, a flak jacket and holding up a camera.

This, she said, ""is how I will chose to remember James -- as a brave and tireless journalist with a passion for the Syrian cause.""

Horrific video of American freelance photo-journalist James Wright Foley, 40, being beheaded by ISIS in revenge for US airstrikes in Iraq was posted to the internet Tuesday afternoon.
Foley, has been missing since November, 2012, after being taken hostage at gunpoint while reporting from Taftanaz, in northern Syria, for the agency, GlobalPost. 
ISIS posted the extremely graphic video shot at an unknown location, titled 'A Message to America' to social media as proof of their barbaric actions.
In a chilling warning at the end of grisly film, the executioner, who has what sounds like a British accent, paraded another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, who went missing in August 2013, saying: 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.'

The video emerged as President Barack Obama was returning from the White House to his Martha's Vineyard vacation. White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says the administration has seen the video. 
She says that if it’s deemed genuine by the intelligence community, the US would be ‘appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist.’
His family issued a statement through their Free James Foley organization, which has been working to free the journalist.
'We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.'
As the disturbing video infolds, Foley, dressed in orange and on his knees, is unflinching to the end as he addresses the camera before his death. 
It appears the journalist has been coerced into blaming the United States by his brutal captors. His voice strong, but struggling at times to swallow as he battles against fear, he brands the US government his real killers as a man in black robes armed with a gun stands over him.

Foley who has been missing for almost two years also leaves a haunting message for his brother, John, who is thought to be in the US Air Force. 
Referring to US airstrikes launched nearly two weeks ago in Iraq, Foley says: ‘I died that day, John, when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people. They signed my death certificate’ 
As the appalling video unfolds, Foley blames the 'complacency and criminality' of the United States for his impending death.
In his final, awful message to the world, Foley pleads for more time, to have seen his family who fought for his freedom for two years again. In a final insult from his vengeful executioners, Foley is made to deny his birthright as a citizen of the United States.
'I wish I had more time, I wish I could have the hope of freedom and see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American,' says Foley before his tragic death.

The reporter then stops speaking and his executioner steps forward. The masked, armed and black robe-clad man speaks in English in what is thought to be a British accent.
Members of the UK's Associated Press pegged the accent to the South East of England and London, while others have claimed the accent resembles one from North Africa.
‘This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country. As a government you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State,' begins the executioner.
'You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs. Today, your military airforce is attacking us daily in Iraq. 
'Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. 
'We are an Islamic Army and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide. 
'So effectively, any aggression toward the Islamic State is aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership.
'So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.’

At this point the executioner beheads Foley, who is kneeling bravely with hands tied behind his back. His body is displayed with the head atop the body.
Then in another chilling warning, the executioner holds another man, on his kness with his hands tied behind his back, by the scruff of the neck. A caption claims it is Steven Joel Soltoff.
The executioner says: ‘The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.’
GlobalPost's co-founder, Charles Sennott told ABC News that there is 'no reliable proof that this execution is authentic.
'If the video is verified, it is just unfathomable darkness to think that a life as bright as Jim Foley's ended that way,' Sennott said. 'He was an experienced and fearless journalist who believed deeply in reporting from the frontlines.' 
The gruesome video clip opens with President Obama announcing the commencement of American air strikes on Iraq against ISIS.
'Today I authorized two operations in Iraq: targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water, and facing almost certain death,' says Obama in a statement dated, August 7.
ISIS, which has claimed control of most of northern Iraq and parts of Syria is threatening to kill Time journalist Joel Sotloff next unless President Obama ceases attacks on the terror group. 
Sotloff has been missing since the middle of 2013 and last tweeted on August 3rd, 2013.
According to his Twitter account he was in Libya at the time of his disappearance.
Foley’s family including parents John and Diane, of Rochester, New Hampshire, have publicly appealed for their son’s release over the past two years.
Foley was previously held captive by pro-Gaddafi forces in Libya.

The barbaric beheading comes one day after ISIS militants threatened to attack U.S. targets 'in any place' in a chilling video showing a blood-spattered Star and Stripes next to the jihadist flag with the message in English: 'We will drown all of you in blood'.
Unlike Al Qaeda, the Islamic State has so far focused on seizing land in Iraq and Syria for its self-proclaimed caliphate, not spectacular attacks on Western targets.
It came as President Barack Obama on Monday announced that Kurdish peshmerga troops, supported by U.S. jets, had recaptured the strategically important Mosul Dam, hailing the offensive as a 'major step forward'.
The dam had given the militants control over power and water supplies, and any breach of the vulnerable structure would have threatened thousands of lives.
As the U.S. military strikes the Islamic State group in Iraq, Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces also stepped up their own campaign against militant strongholds in Syria.

Foley, who lived Boston, was previously held captive by pro-Gaddafi forces for six weeks in Libya in 2011.
He was released after 45 days following an international campaign by his friends and family.
The Foley family from Rochester, New Hampshire, had hoped keeping silent could aid his release from Syria, but early last year decided to appeal directly to his kidnappers, increasingly concerned as they grew increasingly concerned.
'We want Jim to come safely home, or at least we need to speak with him to know he's okay,' his father John Foley said in a statement in January 2013 as the Foley family launched a website to publicize his disappearance, 'Jim is an objective journalist and we appeal for the release of Jim unharmed. To the people who have Jim, please contact us so we can work together toward his release.'
James, or Jim as he is known to his family and friends, is one of five children to parents John and Diane Foley. 
Foley, who studied at Marquette University, Milwaukee, and later studied journalism at Northwestern University, Chicago, has also reported on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Prior to a career in journalism, he taught reading and writing skills to convicted felons at Cook County Jail in Chicago.","1"

A group called Free James Foley had been dedicated to finding and saving Foley since his disappearance.

"Missing American journalist reportedly beheaded by Islamic State ","AN American journalist who has been missing for almost two years has reportedly been executed by the Islamic State (IS).

James Wright Foley went missing in on November 22, 2012, while reporting from Syria.

But a shocking video apparently shows the 40-year-old being beheaded by IS (formerly known as Isis) forces.

Before the execution a masked man dressed in black stands over Foley as he is forced to read a letter labelling the US government as his killers.

He says: ""I call on my friends family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government. For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality.""

The journalist is also then made to address his brother John, who is a member of the US airforce.

He says: ""I died that day, John, when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people. They signed my death certificate.""

The militant group is now also threatening to kill Time journalist Joel Sotloff, unless Barack Obama calls a halt to US attacks.

Mr Sotloff disappeared in 2013 and last tweeted on August 3 that year, when he was understood to be in Libya.

The executioner claims Sotloff's fate ""depends"" on President Obama's ""next decision"".

After a grisly video was released by IS militants last night, his family said they ""have never been prouder of him"".

""He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.""

IS, who have captured large swathes of Syria and northern Iraq in recent weeks, described the killing of Mr Foley as retribution for recent US airstrikes in Iraq.

They are now also threatening to kill Time journalist Joel Sotloff, unless President Barack Obama calls a halt to military action designed to prevent an IS slaughter of religious minorities in the country.

In the statement, Mrs Foley added: ""We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages.

Post by Free James Foley.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond described the death of Mr Foley, from Rochester in New Hampshire, as an ""appalling example of the brutality of this organisation"".

In the video Mr Foley, who was a freelancer for Agence France-Presse and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost, is seen kneeling in a desert-like environment at an unknown location as an IS fighter stands by his side dressed in black and with his face covered.

Mr Hammond said the video had not been verified but ""all the hallmarks point to it being genuine"" and acknowledged that the killer spoke with a British accent.

The Foreign Secretary told the BBC: ""We have been saying for a long time that there are a significant number of British nationals in Syria and Iraq operating with extremist organisations.

""That's one of the reasons why this organisation represents such a direct threat to the UK's national security.

""Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the UK and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.""

Mr Hammond described the ideology of militant groups as ""a poison"" and ""a cancer"".

He added: ""We are absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities, making jihad with IS and other extremist organisations.

""This is something we have been tracking and dealing with for many, many months, I don't think this video changes anything it just heightens awareness of a situation which is very grave and which we have been working on for many months.""","1"

Mr Foley was on assignment for Agence France-Press and the Boston-based GlobalPost in northern Syria when his car was stopped by militants in 2012.

Around 20 journalists are currently missing in Syria, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.

Mr Foley told the BBC in a 2012 interview that he was ""drawn to the drama of the conflict and trying to expose untold stories"".

He said: ""There's extreme violence, but there's a will to find who these people really are. And I think that's what's really inspiring about it.""

Filmmaker Matthew VanDyke, a friend of Mr Foley's, said that the journalist knew his job carried risks but ""believed in what he was doing.""

He said seeing news reports of his friend's death was ""a complete nightmare"" and urged other reporters in Syria and Iraq to take precautions, saying ""if it can happen to him, it can happen to anybody"".

Mr VanDyke said: ""He was certainly aware of the dangers, he was very professional.

""He had a love for what he did and he wanted to tell the story of the Syrian people. And nothing was going to stop him from doing that.""

Mr VanDyke added that IS did not even exist when Foley was captured in Syria in 2012.

Philip Balboni, chief executive of GlobalPost, paid tribute to their employee, and thanked the public on behalf of Mr Foley's parents.

""On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim's possible execution first broke.

""We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic. ... We ask for your prayers for Jim and his family.""

The beheading, if confirmed, will be the first time Islamic State fighters have killed an American since the conflict broke out in Syria in 2011.

"Tougher laws if needed to deal with extremism after 'barbaric' killing, says David Cameron","PRIME Minister David Cameron today condemned the killing of a journalist by what appears to be a British man fighting with Islamic State (IS) militants.

In a chilling video, US journalist James Wright Foley is shown kneeling next to a IS extremist who appears to speak with a British accent, before he is killed.

Addressing reporters in Downing Street, Mr Cameron vowed the Government will redouble its efforts to prevent young Britons from travelling to join the group.

Mr Cameron said it seemed ""increasingly likely"" that a British citizen was the killer, adding: ""Let me condemn the barbaric and brutal act that has taken place and let's be clear what this act is - it is an act of murder, and murder without any justification.

""We have not identified the individual responsible, but from what we have seen it looks increasingly likely that it is a British citizen.

""This is deeply shocking. But we know that far too many British citizens have travelled to Iraq and travelled to Syria to take part in extremism and violence.

""And what we must do is redouble all our efforts to stop people from going. To take away the passports of those contemplating travel, arrest and prosecute those who take part in this extremism and violence.

""To take extremist material off the internet and do everything we can to keep our people safe. And that is what this Government will do.""

As well as repeating his stance that Britain will not get involved in another military conflict in Iraq, Mr Cameron also suggested new laws could be introduced to prevent Britons leaving the country to join IS in Syria and Iraq.

He said: ""I have been very clear that this country is not going to get involved in another Iraq war. We are not putting combat troops, combat boots on the ground, that is not something we should do.

""We have a clear strategy, we should stick to that strategy, and specifically here at home we have very clear laws, tough laws, and of course we will always look at new proposals for even tougher laws to deal with terrorism and extremism.

""This is not a time for a knee-jerk reaction. It is time for what Britain always shows in these circumstances, and that is a resolve. We have defeated terrorism, extremism, threats to our country before, and we will defeat them again if we show that resolve, but also patience.

""This struggle against Islamist extremism - not a struggle of one religion against another - it is of all people and all religions including Islam against a poisonous extremism, we must show patience and resolve in fighting this, here at home in the UK and in other parts of the world where countries have been affected.""

US President Barack Obama also today vowed that America will continue to confront extremists.

""We will continue to confront this hateful terrorism and replace it with a sense of hope and stability.

""That's what Jim Foley stood for. A man who lived his work, who courageously told the stories of his fellow human beings and who was liked and loved by friends and family.""

A video showing the murder of Mr Foley was today confirmed by the US officials as authentic.

The 40-year-old disappeared on November 22, 2012, while reporting from Syria.

After a grisly video apparently showing his execution was released by IS militants last night, his family said they ""have never been prouder of him"".

David Cameron has returned to Downing Street today to hold meetings with Home and Foreign Office staff over the murder, which he described as ""shocking and depraved"".

The Prime Minister, who was on holiday in Cornwall with his family, is meeting Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and senior security forces officials following the release of the video.

A No 10 spokeswoman said: ""The Prime Minister is returning to Downing Street this morning. He will meet with the Foreign Secretary and senior officials from the Home Office, Foreign Office and the agencies to discuss the situation in Iraq and Syria and the threat posed by (Islamic State) terrorists.""

In a message posted to a Facebook page created to rally support for Foley's release, his mum Diane said: ""We have never been prouder of our son Jim.

""He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.""

British counter-terrorism police have launched an investigation into the video, and have also warned social media users that sharing it online in the UK may constitute an offence.

Hammond said British intelligence services would work closely with the United States to try to identify the man and a specialist counter-terrorism police unit launched an investigation into the contents of the video.

A US National Security spokeswoman said that they believed the video, which also showed another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, was authentic.

Caitlin Hayden said: ""The US Intelligence Community has analysed the recently released video showing U.S. citizens James Foley and Steven Sotloff.

""We have reached the judgment that this video is authentic. We will continue to provide updates as they are available.""

IS, who have captured large swathes of Syria and northern Iraq in recent weeks, described the killing of Mr Foley as retribution for recent US airstrikes in Iraq.

They are now also threatening to kill Time journalist Joel Sotloff, unless President Barack Obama calls a halt to military action designed to prevent an IS slaughter of religious minorities in the country.

In the statement, Mrs Foley added: ""We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages.

""Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.

""We thank Jim for all the joy he gave us. He was an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person.

""Please respect our privacy in the days ahead as we mourn and cherish Jim.""

Mr Foley was on assignment for Agence France-Press and the Boston-based GlobalPost in northern Syria when his car was stopped by militants in 2012.

Around 20 journalists are currently missing in Syria, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.

Mr Foley told the BBC in a 2012 interview that he was ""drawn to the drama of the conflict and trying to expose untold stories"".

He said: ""There's extreme violence, but there's a will to find who these people really are. And I think that's what's really inspiring about it.""

Filmmaker Matthew VanDyke, a friend of Mr Foley's, said that the journalist knew his job carried risks but ""believed in what he was doing.""

He said seeing news reports of his friend's death was ""a complete nightmare"" and urged other reporters in Syria and Iraq to take precautions, saying ""if it can happen to him, it can happen to anybody"".

Mr VanDyke said: ""He was certainly aware of the dangers, he was very professional.

""He had a love for what he did and he wanted to tell the story of the Syrian people. And nothing was going to stop him from doing that.""

Mr VanDyke added that IS did not even exist when Foley was captured in Syria in 2012.

Philip Balboni, chief executive of GlobalPost, paid tribute to their employee, and thanked the public on behalf of Mr Foley's parents.

""On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim's possible execution first broke.

""We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic. ... We ask for your prayers for Jim and his family.""

The beheading, if confirmed, will be the first time Islamic State fighters have killed an American since the conflict broke out in Syria in 2011.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond described the death of Mr Foley, from Rochester in New Hampshire, as an ""appalling example of the brutality of this organisation"".

In the video, Mr Foley is seen kneeling in a desert-like environment at an unknown location as an IS fighter stands by his side dressed in black and with his face covered.

Mr Hammond said the video had not been verified but ""all the hallmarks point to it being genuine"" and acknowledged that the killer spoke with a British accent.

The Foreign Secretary told the BBC: ""We have been saying for a long time that there are a significant number of British nationals in Syria and Iraq operating with extremist organisations.

""That's one of the reasons why this organisation represents such a direct threat to the UK's national security.

""Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the UK and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.""

Mr Hammond described the ideology of militant groups as ""a poison"" and ""a cancer"".

He added: ""We are absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities, making jihad with IS and other extremist organisations.

""This is something we have been tracking and dealing with for many, many months, I don't think this video changes anything it just heightens awareness of a situation which is very grave and which we have been working on for many months.""

He also warned that military success against IS in Iraq and Syria could be the trigger for fighters returning to their countries of origin.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm afraid I think it's heads we win, tails we lose in this. If the Islamic State, so-called, becomes established in an area of Syria and Iraq, it will undoubtedly use it as a base for launching attacks on the West. It will undoubtedly send its fighters out to attack Western targets.

""Equally, if it gets pushed back, some of these people will return to their countries of origin. It's not just the UK, it's all European countries, Australia, the United States, other Arab countries.

""We will see these people going back and potentially carrying on their fight in our own homelands.""

A campaign on Twitter, backed by celebrities including Mia Farrow, has been launched to stop people sharing the video of the murder.

Twitter's chief executive Dick Costolo said the firm was taking action against accounts which spread the video.","1"
"Isis claims to behead US journalist","Islamist militants claim to have beheaded a man identified as James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in Syria in late 2012, in a graphic video posted on the internet.
A spokeswoman for the White House said the intelligence community was trying to determine the video’s authenticity. “If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American

The video entitled “Message to #America (from the #IslamicState)” purporting to show “James Wright Foley” on his knees ahead of his execution by a man whose identity is disguised and who speaks with a distinct British accent.


At the end of the video, the same person holds up a second person, who is identified with a caption on the screen as Steven Sotloff, a journalist kidnapped in 2013, and says: “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”
Last week, social media accounts controlled by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or Isis, uploaded videos showing dozens of beheadings of individuals they accused of being sympathisers of the regime of Bashar al-Assad, President of Syria, in the northern Syrian town of Deir Ezzor.
The posting of the latest video by Isis comes days after President Barack Obama ordered an intensifying series of air strikes on the militants in northern Iraq.
The immediate aim of the strikes was to back Kurdish and Iraqi forces in their efforts to retake Mosul Dam, a strategic asset which the militants had gained control of in their recent military surge.
Mr Obama has said that Washington will not send troops to Iraq to engage Isis in combat but administration officials have expanded the US military mission there over the last week to halt and push back the militant’s advance.
“We believe that Isis needs to be taken out,” Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said this week.
An estimated 500 Britons have travelled to fight with extremist groups in Syria – most from London – and almost all have joined Isis, according to UK security officials.
British intelligence believes that several have travelled into Iraq and that some have almost certainly been involved in the worst of Isis’ atrocities.
The apparent murder of Mr Foley is a violent reminder of some of the most graphic crimes committed by Isis’s predecessor organisation, al-Qaeda in Iraq, which gruesomely beheaded dozens of Iraqis and foreigners, uploading videos of the acts to the internet, under the command of the militant group’s then leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, nearly a decade ago.
The beheading of American citizen Nicholas Berg in 2004 by Mr Zarqawi himself propelled AQI to the forefront of the war on terror and marked the beginning of a new particularly bloody phase in the Iraqi extremist insurgency in the wake of the US-led invasion.
AQI’s other high profile victims included Americans Jack Hensley and Eugene Armstrong, Briton Kenneth Bigley and South Korean Kim Sun Il.
Mr Zarqawi was killed in northern Iraq in 2006 in a US air strike, and AQI was subsequently driven underground by a surge in American troops in Iraq and a groundswell of Sunni support – financed by the West – in fighting the jihadi group.
The core of AQI’s ideological and operational beliefs and practices has survived in Isis however. The group has inherited many of the hallmarks of AQI, and has been posting videos of beheadings of Assad-regime soldiers and Iraqi Shia and Kurds online for months.
Early assessments by many in the Western intelligence community concluded that Isis was primarily a group focused on a violent regional and sectarian struggle.
With Isis’ declaration of a “caliphate” in June, however, and with it a direct challenge to what remains of al-Qaeda, many European and American security officials have grown more worried about its international ambitions.
Since air strikes against the group by the US began, intelligence officials have grown more worried over Isis’ attack planning against the West.
Of the estimated 3,000 Europeans who travelled to Syria to fight against Mr Assad’s regime, the majority have become Isis members and represent a potential terrorist risk to Western states.","1"
"James Foley, Missing American Photojournalist, Reportedly Executed By ISIS In Syria","James Foley, an American journalist who went missing in Syria more than a year ago, has reportedly been executed by the Islamic State, a militant group formerly known as ISIS.

Foley was in Syria covering the country's civil war when he went missing in November 2012. A May 2013 report from the Columbia Journalism Review said that he was likely being held near Damascus.

The National Security Council issued a statement about Foley's apparent murder:

On Tuesday, the group formerly known as ISIS released a video of militants beheading Foley, claiming it was in retribution for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. The Federal Bureau of Investigations said Wednesday they believe the video to be authentic.

Obama said he spoke to Foley's family earlier Wednesday to offer his condolences.

""Jim Foley's life stands in stark contrast to his killers,"" Obama said. ""Let's be clear about ISIL. They have rampaged across cities and villages killing unarmed citizens in cowardly acts of violence. ... No faith teaches people to massacre innocents. No just God would stand for what they did yesterday and what they do every single day.""

""Their ideology is bankrupt,"" he said. ""People like this ultimately fail. They fail because the future is won by those who build and not destroy.""

Obama pledged to continue to ""do what is necessary"" to protect Americans and support the Iraqi forces fighting back the extremist group, despite their threats.

"Islamic State releases video apparently showing the beheading of missing US journalist James Foley","The White House is attempting to verify footage released by the Islamic State (IS) purporting to show the killing of an American journalist in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

The video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man cloaked in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012. The White House said it was working to establish the video's authenticity, but if it was genuine, the US would be “appalled by the brutal murder”.

Foley has worked in a number of conflict zones in the Middle East, including Syria, Libya and Iraq. He and another journalist were working in the northern province of Idlib in Syria when they were kidnapped in November 2012 near the village of Taftanaz.

The video opened with a clip of US President Barack Obama saying he had authorised strikes in Iraq. “Obama authorises military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,” words appear in English and Arabic on the screen. It showed black and white aerial footage of air strikes with text saying “American aggression against the Islamic State”

A person identified as James Foley and wearing an orange outfit is seen kneeling in the desert as a man in black dress with a black mask stands beside him, holding a knife. “I call on my friends family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” the kneeling man says.

The man in the mask says: “This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen, of your country. As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State. Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide.”

Following his statement he beheads the kneeling man.

The video also shows a second man on his knees, who is named as Steven Sotloff, another American journalist, who was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013. After bringing out Sotloff, the masked executioner addresses the US President directly, saying: “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”

The Islamic State had not previously executed American citizens publicly. The video was posted after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq for the first time since the end of the US occupation in 2011. A Twitter account set up by Mr Foley’s family to help find him said early on Wednesday: “We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers.

"James Wright Foley, Kidnapped Journalist, Apparently Executed by ISIS","The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) claims to have beheaded an American photojournalist and has threatened the life of another American if President Obama doesn't stop airstrikes in Iraq.

A graphic video obtained by NBC News purportedly shows James Wright Foley, a freelance reporter for the U.S.-based news service GlobalPost who was kidnapped while reporting from Syria two years ago, reciting threats against America before he is executed by an ISIS militant.

Foley was kidnapped at gunpoint near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Thanksgiving Day in 2012. He had not been heard from during his time in captivity. ""We’ve heard nothing. Nothing. We last knew that he was abducted on Thanksgiving Day in the Idlib province, but we don’t know who took him or why,"" Foley's father, John, said on TODAY last year.

Foley traveled extensively in the Middle East and North Africa. He reported about conflicts from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, where he was once held captive for 44 days.

In May 2011, Foley recorded a video interview with The Boston Globe about his arrest and captivity in Libya. “You don’t want to be defined as that guy who got captured in 2011,” he said. “I believe that front-line journalism is important.”

In the video, ISIS claims they are holding a second journalist, Steven Joel Soltoff. A man on the video is identified as Soltoff and his life is threatened if the United States does not pull out of Iraq.

"James Foley beheaded: ISIS claims to have killed US journalist","US journalist James Foley, believed held captive in Syria, has reportedly been beheaded as a “message” to President Obama.

Unconfirmed video and pictures of photojournalist James Wright Foley’s heartbreaking final moments have been published via Twitter by accounts claiming to be associated with the Islamic State, previously known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

Mr Foley was abducted in Syria, in 2012, while covering the campaign against President Bashar al-Assad. He wrote for a variety of media organisations including the AFP news agency.

The identity of the man in the high-definition footage, titled “A Message to America”, has not yet been officially confirmed. The YouTube file, originally uploaded on Tuesday, has since been deleted.

Friends and family of Mr Foley have released a statement saying they are uncertain of what the video shows. “We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information”, their Facebook group “Free James Foley” reads.

EXECUTION’S BRUTAL MESSAGE

The gruesome video shows a man in orange prisoner fatigues being led to a remote desert location where he is forced to kneel before reciting a message urging Americans to rise against his “real killer” — the United States.

“I call on my friends, family, and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government,” he is heard to say. “For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality.

The US government has issued a statement saying the intelligence community is working to verify the identity of the men shown in the footage.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express the deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

TERROR PROPAGANDA TARGETS FAMILY

In the video, the man, who is reported to be Foley, looks calm as he kneels with his hands tied behind his back. Speaking in a level voice with a a microphone attached to his orange robe, he can sometimes be heard swallowing as he bravely continues his speech.

“I call on my brother John, who is a member of the US air force. Think about what you are doing, think about the lives you destroy, including those of your own family.”

He goes on to attack the integrity of the US government decision: “Think John, who did they really kill? And did they think about me, you, our family when they made that decision?”

His statement, which is presumed to have been prepared for him by the militants, ends with: “I guess all in all I wish I wasn’t American.”

It’s not the first time Foley has been held captive. He was taken by government forces in while covering the 2011 uprising against Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi. He was released after six weeks.

In the video released today, the man belived to be Foley is beheaded with a knife by a black-masked man who speaks with what sounds to be a British accent.

“Any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people,” the executioner intones.

The Islamic State has issued a warning with the video: There will be more executions if President Obama does not end air strikes in aid of the embattled Kurdish and Iraqi Government forces.

“We will drown all of you in blood,” the jihadists state.

TWO MORE CAPTIVES THREATENED

The propaganda video also shows what it claims to be another US captive, identified as journalist Steven Joel Sotloff.

The dialogue then states his future depends on President Obama’s “next decision”.

Mr Sotloff is a freelance journalist who was abducted in Syria in August 2013.

A third prisoner has been threatened in a separate statement attributed to the Islamic State and addressed to his family.

Warren Weinstein is named as a prisoner the jihadists wish to exchange for one of their own members held by unnamed Western-affiliated forces.

The open letter, circulating on Twitter, threatens that if Mr Weinstein’s family do not oppose their government, their son will suffer.

“Your continued silence on the inaction of your government will only lead to your prisoner dying a lonely death in prison after this deliberate and prolonged neglect on the part of your government,” the document reads.

“Therefore, if you want Warren Weinstein to be released; do whatever you can to pressurize your government”.","1"
"Video Purports To Show Beheading Of U.S. Journalist By Militants","Extremist group the Islamic State claims to have executed American journalist James Foley, who was abducted in Syria in 2012. The FBI is evaluating a video that was posted online Tuesday, purporting to show Foley's beheading.

That video was uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday afternoon and later removed. The images show a man resembling Foley kneeling next to a masked militant, reciting comments against the U.S. before being killed.

U.S. officials tell the Associated Press that Islamic State had recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge U.S. airstrikes that have helped Iraqi forces regain key sites, including the Mosul dam.

The Islamic State also says it's holding another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, who went missing in Syria last year, and that Sotloff could be the next victim.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says U.S. officials are studying the video to determine whether it's genuine:

Foley has been missing since November of 2012, when he was kidnapped while reporting in Syria for the news organization GlobalPost. A Facebook page was later created to call for his return; last night, it posted this statement from Foley's mother, Diane:

GlobalPost notes that, ""The Foley family has not received confirmation of Jim's death from the U.S. government, and acknowledged that there is still a small chance the video of his apparent killing will prove to have been fake.""

The company's CEO and co-founder, Philip Balboni, says GlobalPost had been working to learn who kidnapped Foley, and where he was being held captive.

""Although GlobalPost's investigation at one point led us to believe that James was being held by the Syrian government, we later were given strong reason to believe he was being held by Islamic militants in Syria,"" Balboni said. ""We withheld this information at the request of the family and on the advice of authorities cooperating in the effort to protect Jim. GlobalPost, working with a private security company, has amassed an enormous amount of information that has not been made public.""

Foley was on a freelance assignment for GlobalPost when he was abducted in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. He had been making his way to the Turkish border when he was stopped by a group of armed men, the organization says.

Back in 2011, Foley was one of three journalists who were held captive for more than a month after being attacked by Gaddafi fighters near Benghazi. A fourth journalist didn't survive the attack.

Their ordeal led Foley and one of his colleagues, American Claire Gillis, to visit NPR's Talk of the Nation back in 2011. Discussing the uncertain weeks of their captivity, Foley said they ""turned to a lot of prayer"" and exercise. In the end, he was the last of the journalists to be released, after spending a week as the sole Westerner in the prison.

""I started to have some dark thoughts,"" he said. ""I started to think, you know, maybe they're keeping the American guy as the ace in the hole... I thought maybe I was going to be a bargaining chip.""","1"

""I started to have some dark thoughts,"" he said. ""I started to think, you know, maybe they're keeping the American guy as the ace in the hole. ... I thought maybe I was going to be a bargaining chip.""","1"
"ISIS militants appear to behead abducted American journalist James Wright Foley in graphic video","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES. A masked militant claims the murder is in retaliation for American airstrikes against the Islamic State militants in Iraq. Missing since Nov. 22, 2012, Foley appears to be forced to read an anti-American statement before he is beheaded in the gruesome five-minute clip.

An American freelance photojournalist missing since being abducted in Syria some 22 months ago was apparently beheaded by an Islamic State militant in a graphic video released Tuesday.

Titled “A Message to America,” the gruesome clip shows a masked militant saw away at the neck of James Wright Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native captured in Binesh, Syria on Thanksgiving Day 2012.

The family, on its ""Free James Foley"" Facebook page, has yet to confirm his death.

""Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers,"" the statement reads.

Foley, dressed in orange and kneeling in a desert, reads what appears to be a coerced statement that alludes to recent American airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government. For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” Foley reads as he kneels beside an armed militant, masked and dressed all in black. “My message to my beloved parents: Save me some dignity, and don’t accept some minor compensation for my death from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with their recent aerial campaign in Iraq. I call on my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force: Think about what you are doing. Think about the lives you destroy, including those of your own family … I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.”

The militant, speaking English with what appears to a British accent, threatens America and President Obama, directly after Foley finishes speaking.

“So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people,” the man says, gesturing with a knife he then uses to behead Foley.

The clip begins with a video of President Obama announcing Aug. 7. American intervention in Iraq against the militants.

“Today I authorized two operations in Iraq: targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water, and facing almost certain death,” Obama said in the clip.

The 40-year-old New Hampshire native has been missing since 2012.

James Foley was reporting in the Middle East when abducted.

Foley, 40, is a New Hampshire native. He was reporting in the Middle East when abducted.

Toward the end of the video, the terror group threatens to kill another hostage, Steven Joel Soltoff, a journalist who has contributed to TIME and has been missing since the middle of last year.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the man says as he holds Soltoff by the neck.

The nearly five-minute clip has since been removed from YouTube. It’s unclear where, exactly, the murder was filmed.

The White House, in a statement from National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden, confirmed they ""have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley.""

""The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity,"" the statement reads. ""If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deppest condolences to his family and friends.""

"Militant Group Says It Killed American Journalist in Syria","The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria posted a video on Tuesday that it said showed the beheading of James Foley, an American journalist who was kidnapped in Syria nearly two years ago, according to a transcript released by the SITE Intelligence Group.

The authenticity of the video, which was also posted on YouTube, could not be verified, and a telephone call placed to Mr. Foley’s family was not immediately returned. YouTube later took down the four-minute, 40-second video.

The Lede: Investigation Suggests American Journalist Missing in Syria Is ‘Likely’ Held by GovernmentMAY 3, 2013
Titled “A Message to America,” the video shows the journalist kneeling in a desert landscape, clad in an orange jumpsuit — an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Standing to his left is a masked ISIS fighter, who begins speaking in English, with what sounds like an East London accent. Pulling out a knife, he says that Mr. Foley’s execution is in retaliation for the recent American airstrikes ordered by President Obama against the extremist group in Iraq.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers — the U.S. government — for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” Mr. Foley says in the video, which was uploaded to the online account of the al-Furqan Media Foundation, according to SITE, an organization that follows jihadist groups. He ends saying that when American soldiers began dropping bombs on Iraq this month, “they signed my death certificate.”

On Tuesday night, Mr. Foley’s mother, Diane Foley, issued a statement on the Facebook page the family had created to publicize their son’s disappearance: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people. We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”

Two weeks ago, in the wake of American-led airstrikes against the terrorist group, which was fanning out across Iraq, jihadists had taken to social media to call for attacks on American interests. In the three hours after the graphic video of Mr. Foley’s beheading was uploaded on YouTube, jihadists using the hashtag “#NewMessageFromISIStoUS” surpassed 2,000 tweets, according to a survey by SITE, with many fighters gloating over his death, and calling it just retribution for the air raids.

Mr. Foley, 40, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost, an online publication based in Boston, as well as for Agence France-Presse, disappeared in Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. He was held alongside several other Americans, whose families have asked for a news blackout.

The video concludes with the fighter threatening to kill Steven Sotloff, another American freelance journalist, who was being held alongside Mr. Foley. Mr. Sotloff is seen kneeling in the same position, in the same landscape and wearing the same style of orange-colored jumpsuit. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the fighter says.

Mr. Obama was briefed about the video by Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, on Air Force One as he returned to Martha’s Vineyard, according to Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary.

In Washington, a National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, said in a statement: “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist,” she said, using an alternative name for ISIS.

Reached by telephone, Philip Balboni, the chief executive and a founder of GlobalPost, said that the newsroom and Mr. Foley’s family were also trying to establish the veracity of the footage. “We are still evaluating the video at this time,” he said.

Mr. Foley, who was last seen in Binesh, Syria, was also abducted in Libya in 2011, where he was held for several weeks after running into troops loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s crumbling government.

He was among dozens of journalists — many of them freelancers without the formal backing of a news organization — who disappeared in 2012 and 2013 in Syria.

"Obama, Outraged Over Beheading, Vows to Stay on Course","President Obama declared that the entire world was “appalled” by the beheading of an American journalist by militants in Syria, but vowed that America would not change course in Iraq, where the United States has been conducting airstrikes against terrorists, despite threats by the group to kill another reporter in the days ahead.

“The United States of America will continue to do what we must do to protect our people,” Mr. Obama said in a brief statement from Martha’s Vineyard, where he was vacationing. “We will be vigilant and we will be relentless.”

Before speaking to reporters, Mr. Obama said he placed a phone call to the parents of James Foley, the slain reporter, telling them that Americans were “are all heartbroken at their loss.” He described Mr. Foley as a “journalist, a son, a brother and a friend who was “taken from us in an act of violence that shocked the conscience of the entire world.”

But the president’s harshest and most emotional words were reserved for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the militants who released a video of the killing of Mr. Foley on Tuesday. American intelligence agencies on Wednesday verified the authenticity of the video, which shows a masked man decapitating James Foley, an American journalist who was kidnapped in Syria nearly two years ago. It also shows another American captive, the journalist Steven Sotloff, and warns that he would be the next to die.

The president called ISIS a “cancer” in the region and accused them of having “rampaged across cities and villages, killing unarmed civilians in cowardly acts of violence.” He said it had committed torture and rape against innocent women and children and continued to enslave those they did not kill.

“No faith teaches people to massacre innocents,” Mr. Obama said. “No just God would stand for what they did yesterday and what they do every single day. People like this ultimately fail. They fail because the future is won by people who build and not destroy.”

The killing of Mr. Foley triggered a fierce response. The New York Daily News and The New York Post both used the same banner headline on their front pages: “Savages.” Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain released a statement saying “the brutal murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved.”

At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement condemning ISIS for “the horrific murder of journalist James Foley, an abominable crime.” Mr. Ban said “the perpetrators of this and other such horrific crimes must be brought to justice.”

The four-minute, 40-second video was posted on YouTube but the website later took it down. Titled “A Message to America,” it shows Mr. Foley kneeling in a desert landscape, clad in an orange jumpsuit in an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

"Video shows ISIL beheading of photojournalist James Foley","Men claiming to be part of terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant posted a video showing the beheading of freelance photojournalist James Wright Foley, who disappeared in northwest Syria on November 22, 2012. On Wednesday the National Security Council said the video appears to be authentic.

The video starts with a clip of President Barack Obama earlier this month making the announcement that he had authorized targeted strikes in Iraq to protect American interests in Irbil. It then cuts to a title scene that says ""Message to America"" before cutting to a desert scene, with Foley in orange clothes on his knees, and a man in all black standing next to him. 

In the video Foley delivers a statement calling on his friends and family to ""rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government.""

Then the ISIL member makes a statement. Speaking in what may possibly be a British accent, he identifies Foley and says his death is a direct result of American intervention in Iraq. 

""So any attempt by you Obama, to deny the Muslims of living in safety under Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

He then beheads Foley.

Freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff is then shown also in an orange jumpsuit on his knees. The man in black then says ""The life of this American citizen Obama, depends on your next decision.""

About 20 minutes after posting the video was removed from YouTube.

According to BuzzFeed, two people who know Foley confirmed that the man in the video looks and sounds like him. A statement attributed to Foley's mother Diane and posted to the ""Free James Foley"" Facebook page said the family has ""never been prouder of our son"" and implored the kidnappers to keep those still captive alive.

""We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" Diane Foley said in the statement. ""We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world. We thank Jim for all the joy he gave us. He was an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person. Please respect our privacy in the days ahead as we mourn and cherish Jim.""

White House Deputy Spokesperson Eric Schultz said President Barack Obama was briefed on the video Tuesday night by Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes and will continue to receive regular updates, according to White House pool report.

In a statement, National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said that if the video is genuine they are ""appalled by the brutal murder."" 

""We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available,"" Hayden said.

On Wednesday, Hayden said in a statement that the video had been deemed authentic.

""The U.S. Intelligence community has analyzed the recently released video showing U.S. citizens James Foley and Steven Sotloff. We have reached the judgment that this video is authentic. We will continue to provide updates as they are available,"" Hayden said.

Foley, 40, grew up in New Hampshire and was originally a teacher, at one point teaching prison inmates in Arizona, before attending the Medill school of journalism at Northwestern University. After graduation, his first assignment was as an embed with the U.S. Army’s 173rd Brigade and 101st Airborne Division in Afghanistan.  Foley had been covering the Syria's civil war for GlobalPost and Agence France-Presse (AFP) when he was allegedly pulled from the car he was traveling in to meet with a colleague and abducted at gunpoint. According to the Columbia Journalism Review, GlobalPost hired an international security firm for a ground level investigation in Northern Syria and along the Turkish border to locate him.

Foley was also detained and held for 44 days in Libya in 2011.

"Journalist James Wright Foley reportedly beheaded by ISIS","A video has surfaced purporting to depict American journalist James Wright Foley being beheaded by those who claim to be ISIS rebels. James Wright Foley disappeared in northwest Syria on November 22, 2012.

The video features text saying “Obama authorizes military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.” It then cuts to a clip of Obama announcing airstrikes against ISIS and then to Foley kneeling in orange, next to a man wearing black with his face covered. In it, Foley is forced to read a letter urging Americans to rise up against his “real killer,” the “U.S. government.” I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killer, the U.S. government. What will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality.”

According to Time’s Mirren Gidda:

American airstrikes began earlier this month in an attempt to help thousands of people—members of the Yazidi, an ethnic minority in the region—who were trapped on a mountain range by fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS). President Barack Obama formally told Congress on Sunday that he had sanctioned additional air raids, though he said they would be limited. The new strikes, requested by the Iraqi government, were intended to help Iraqi and Kurdish security forces who had been battling the militants for control of the strategic Mosul Dam. Aided by U.S. air support, these troops successfully recaptured it on Aug. 18.

The video also shows a man on his knees who is allegedly Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who went missing in Syria on Aug. 3, 2013. According to the video, Sotloff’s fate depends on Obama’s “next decision.”

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in the first official U.S. reaction to the video: “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIS. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

The White House later said that President Barack Obama, on Air Force One, was briefed on the video by Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes. “The President will continue to receive regular updates,” it said.

The video was later taken down by YouTube for violation of its policies.

Foley’s parents told AFP last year that they were still hoping for his safe return.

But there was little indication where Foley had been until the video appeared on Tuesday. ”We haven’t been contacted by anybody asking for anything. No ransom requests,” father John Foley told AFP at the time.

“We’re staying very hopeful,” mother Diane Foley said. “We’re hearing many rumors but no facts at this point. We’ve just a very strong feeling that Jim is alive.”

Foley was one of an estimated dozens of journalists missing in Syria’s civil war.

ISIS is also known as ISIL, or The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The Council of Foreign Relations says that the group “is a predominantly Sunni jihadist group, seeks to sow civil unrest in Iraq and the Levant (region spanning from southern Turkey to Egypt and including Syria, Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan) with the aim of establishing a caliphate — a single, transnational Islamic state based on sharia.”

It added: “The group emerged in the ashes of the U.S.-led invasion to oust Saddam Hussein as al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), and the insurgency that followed provided it with fertile ground to wage a guerrilla war against coalition forces and their domestic allies.”

The group was originally launched by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who had commanded volunteers in Afghanistan before fleeing to Iraq in 2001. It was there that he joined militant Kurdish separatist movement Ansar al-Islam, which was the precursor to AQI, and led its Arab contingent.

Zarqawi later pledged support to Osama bin Laden, although they had a disagreement over the types of attacks they should launch.

Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. air strike in 2006, at which point Eguptian-born explosives expert Abu Ayyub al-Masti took over. The group is currently led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, also known as Abu Du’a, whi changed the group’s name to Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS), according to the U.S. State Department, which has a $10 million reward for information that helps authorities kill or capture the group’s leader.

Syria strikes militants as US targets them in Iraq

BEIRUT—As the U.S. military strikes the Islamic State group in Iraq, Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces have significantly stepped up their own campaign against militant strongholds in Syria, carrying out dozens of airstrikes against the group’s headquarters in the past two days.

While the government in Damascus has long turned a blind eye to the Islamic State’s expansion in Syria — in some cases even facilitating its offensive against mainstream rebels — the group’s rapid march on towns and villages in northern and eastern Syria is now threatening to overturn recent gains by government forces.

While Islamic State militants have so far concentrated their attacks against the Western-backed fighters seeking to topple Assad, they have in the past month carried out a major onslaught against Syrian army facilities in northeastern Syria, capturing and slaughtering hundreds of Syrian soldiers and pro-government militiamen in the process.

On Monday, Islamic State fighters were closing in on the last government-held army base in the northeastern Raqqa province, the Tabqa air base, prompting at least 16 Syrian government airstrikes in the area in an attempt to halt their advance.

In the northern city of Aleppo, there is a sense of impending defeat among mainstream rebels as Islamic militants systematically routed them last week in towns and villages only a few kilometers (miles) north of the city. An Islamic State takeover of rebel-held parts of Aleppo also would be disastrous for Syrian government troops who have been gaining ground in the city in past months.

“I think they (Syrian government) are finally realizing that their Machiavellian strategy of working with the Islamic State group against the moderates did not work so well, and so they have started to fight it,” said Andrew Tabler, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

But in hitting hard against the Islamic State group, Assad has another motive. His aerial bombardment of militant strongholds in Syria in a way mirrors that of the U.S. military’s airstrikes against extremists across the border in Iraq.

Analysts say Assad’s strikes aim at sending a message that he is on the same side as the Americans, reinforcing the Syrian government’s longstanding claim that it is a partner in the fight against terrorism and a counterbalance to extremists. That comes after the U.S. itself nearly bombed Syria after it blamed Assad’s forces for a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held areas near Damascus last August.

“Assad would surely love to regain international acceptance via a ‘war on terror’ and maybe that is his long-term plan, in so far as he has one,” Syria analyst Aron Lund said.

Even while going against the Islamic State in Iraq, U.S. officials have shown little appetite for striking at the same militants in Syria.

Asked about Syrian government airstrikes targeting the militants, State Department Deputy Spokeswoman Marie Harf rejected the notion that Washington and Damascus are “on the same page” in their fight against the Islamic State as a common enemy.

“While we may be looking at some of the same targets, I think the fact … that the Assad regime has allowed ISIS to flourish and grow in the way it has is really one of the main reasons they have grown so strong,” she said, using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State.

Most of all, however, Assad can simply no longer afford to ignore the growing threat of the Islamic State now that it has started attacking his own forces.

Since July, following their blitz in Iraq and after they declared a self-styled caliphate straddling the Iraq-Syria border, Islamic State fighters have methodically gone after isolated government bases in northern and eastern Syria, killing and decapitating army commanders and pro-government militiamen.

The attacks started with a devastating onslaught on the al-Shaer gas field in Homs province in which more than 270 Syrian soldiers, security guards and workers were killed. Last month, the jihadis overran the sprawling Division 17 military base in Raqqa province, killing at least 85 soldiers. Two weeks later, Islamic State fighters seized the nearby Brigade 93 base after days of heavy fighting.

They now are closing in on Tabqa air base. Activists on Monday reported intense clashes between government troops and Islamic State fighters on the edge of the villages of Ajil and Khazna near Tabqa. The Raqqa Media Center, an activist collective, said the Islamic State captured four villages near the air base, including Ajil.

“They will stop at nothing. If things continue the same way it’s only a matter of time before the Islamic State seizes Aleppo,” said Abu Thabet, an Aleppo rebel commander. He said the jihadis were now looking to take the rebel stronghold of Marea, to be followed by the Bab al-Salama border crossing with Turkey, which would be a major prize and source of money.

Oubai Shahbandar, a Washington-based senior strategist for the Western-backed opposition Syrian National Coalition group, called Assad’s airstrikes against the Islamic States superficial, saying the Western-backed rebels were the only force truly confronting the jihadis.

He also shrugged off any suggestion that Assad and the West share a common enemy in the Islamic State group.

“The choice for the West is clear,” he said. “Assad turned Syria into a springboard for terror, while the opposition leads the anti-Islamic State resistance.”","1"
"James Foley: American Journalist James Wright Foley Beheaded in New Terrorist Video [Breaking News]","James Wright Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in 2012, was beheaded in an ISIS video released on Tuesday, August 19.

The video is titled “A Message to America.”

A figure in a black robe with a gun strapped on his person and a masked hat covering his face, apart from his eyes, appears in the video next to Foley.

In the video, the Islamic State says that U.S. President Barack Obama’s authorization of strikes against the group places the United States “upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,” according to BNO.

“Any attempt by you, Obama, to deny Muslims liberty & safety under the Islamic caliphate, will result in the bloodshed of your people,” the ISIS fighter added.

Foley also speaks in the video, saying: “I call on my friends, family members and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government.”

Foley vanished in northwest Syria on Thanksgiving Day, November 22, in 2012.

Before that, he had reported independently from the Middle East for about five years, according to the Free James Foley website. Foley was 40 years old.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in the first official U.S. reaction to the video: “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIS. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

The White House later confirmed that the video was authentic.

The video was later taken down by YouTube for violation of its policies.

Foley’s parents told AFP last year that they were still hoping for his safe return.

But there was little indication where Foley had been until the video appeared on Tuesday. ”We haven’t been contacted by anybody asking for anything. No ransom requests,” father John Foley told AFP at the time.

“We’re staying very hopeful,” mother Diane Foley said. “We’re hearing many rumors but no facts at this point. We’ve just a very strong feeling that Jim is alive.”

Foley’s parents also confirmed the death in a statement, saying they “have never been prouder of him.”

“He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,” said Diane Foley. She implored the militants to spare the lives of other hostages. “Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”

Foley was one of an estimated dozens of journalists missing in Syria’s civil war.

ISIS is also known as ISIL, or The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The Council of Foreign Relations says that the group “is a predominantly Sunni jihadist group, seeks to sow civil unrest in Iraq and the Levant (region spanning from southern Turkey to Egypt and including Syria, Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan) with the aim of establishing a caliphate — a single, transnational Islamic state based on sharia.”

It added: “The group emerged in the ashes of the U.S.-led invasion to oust Saddam Hussein as al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), and the insurgency that followed provided it with fertile ground to wage a guerrilla war against coalition forces and their domestic allies.”

The group was originally launched by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who had commanded volunteers in Afghanistan before fleeing to Iraq in 2001. It was there that he joined militant Kurdish separatist movement Ansar al-Islam, which was the precursor to AQI, and led its Arab contingent.

Zarqawi later pledged support to Osama bin Laden, although they had a disagreement over the types of attacks they should launch.

Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. air strike in 2006, at which point Eguptian-born explosives expert Abu Ayyub al-Masti took over. The group is currently led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, also known as Abu Du’a, whi changed the group’s name to Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS), according to the U.S. State Department, which has a $10 million reward for information that helps authorities kill or capture the group’s leader.

American journalist killed in Syria aware of risks

ROCHESTER, N.H.—Journalist James Foley had worked in a number of conflict zones in the Middle East, but the danger didn’t stop him from doing the job he loved.

Captured and held for six weeks while covering the uprising in Libya, he knew the risks when he went to Syria two years ago to cover the escalating violence there.

Foley was snatched again in Syria in November 2012 when the car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a battle zone that Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control.

Foley’s family confirmed his death on a webpage created to rally support for him. His mother, Diane Foley, said in a statement on the webpage he “gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.”

At Foley’s family home in Rochester, a light burned yellow in a center upstairs window and a yellow ribbon adorned a tree at the foot of the driveway. The Rev. Paul Gousse, of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary, where the Foleys are parishioners, spent about 45 minutes at the house but left without commenting.

Foley, 40, and another journalist were working in the northern province of Idlib in Syria when they were kidnapped near the village of Taftanaz.

After Foley disappeared, while contributing video for Agence France-Presse and the media company GlobalPost, his parents became fierce advocates for him and all those kidnapped in war zones. They held regular prayer vigils and worked with the U.S. and Syrian diplomatic corps to get whatever scraps of information they could.

Diane Foley, asked in January 2013 if her son had reservations about going to Syria, said softly: “Not enough.”

She wrote Tuesday on the family’s webpage, “We thank Jim for all the joy he gave us. He was an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person.”

Foley had seen the dangers to journalists up close.

Upon his release from Libya and return to the United States, he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press seeing a colleague, South African photographer Anton Hammerl, killed by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. He tried to pull his friend’s body out of harm’s way but was turned back by heavy fire.

“I’ll regret that day for the rest of my life. I’ll regret what happened to Anton,” Foley said. “I will constantly analyze that.”

Foley also covered the war in Afghanistan but called the Libyan fighting the worst he had ever experienced to that point.

Foley grew up in New Hampshire and studied history at Marquette University. He later taught in Arizona, Massachusetts and Chicago before switching careers to become a journalist, which he viewed as a calling.

“Journalism is journalism,” Foley said. “If I had a choice to do Nashua (New Hampshire) zoning meetings or give up journalism, I’ll do it. I love writing and reporting.”

British fighter appears to have role in beheading

LONDON—The black-clad Islamic militant fighter filmed in the beheading of American journalist James Foley appears to be British, the U.K. foreign minister said Wednesday — a development that underscores the insurgents’ increasingly sophisticated use of Western fighters to mobilize recruits and terrorize enemies.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the man in the video with Foley ”appears to have been a British person.”

The masked militant in the clip speaks fluent English with what Lancaster University linguist Claire Hardaker said sounds like a London accent.

Hammond told the BBC that Britain was aware that U.K. nationals were involved in committing atrocities with Islamic State extremists and other organizations.

Hammond says the possible involvement of a Briton underscored the risks that those now fighting with Islamic militants could return to Britain and carry out attacks at home.

British officials have said that several hundred people from Britain have traveled to Syria to join the battle against President Bashar Assad, and some may have crossed into Iraq as part of the rapid advance of the Islamic State group. French and German officials have recently put the combined total of those countries around 1,300.

Shiraz Maher of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King’s College London, said the video was evidence that British jihadis were “some of the most vicious and vociferous fighters” in Syria and Iraq.

“Unfortunately the British participation in the conflicts now raging in both Syria and Iraq has been has been one of full participation, one that has seen them at the front lines, taking part in the conflict in every way,” Maher told BBC radio. “So we have seen British fighters out there operating as suicide bombers, we have seen them operating as executioners.”

The group has previously used Western fighters in its recruitment videos. In June, it released a video showing British and Australian militants exhorting compatriots to join them in violent jihad.

Nigel Inkster, a terrorism expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the videos reflected an increasingly sophisticated media strategy designed to energize recruits and deliver to Western governments and citizens a message “of fear and a perception of inevitability.”","1"

Islamic State, an al-Qaeda offshoot, had not previously executed American citizens publicly. The Sunni militant group has declared a caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria in areas it controls.

Mr. Sotloff is also a freelancer journalist with published stories in Time Magazine and Foreign Policy. He has worked in Syria, Libya and Yemen.

Islamic State has executed hundreds of people in Syria and Iraq during its advance. Its members follow a hard-line interpretation of Sunni Islam but target all those who oppose it, including Sunni Muslims.

"Isis militants claim to have killed US journalist James Foley","Militants from Islamic State (Isis) claimed to have killed an American journalist long held captive in Syria in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

A propaganda video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Wright Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012.

The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said that the slaying came in response to the airstrikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago.

Isis, whose chief spokesman came under State Department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video, the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder.

Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime.

A Facebook message from a support group, Free James Foley, urged patience “until we all have more information,” and asked that readers “keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it, adding a metatextual debate to a depiction of a man’s violent death.

Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity.

A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.”

In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.”

Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement.

Messages left with the Foley family were not returned.

A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.”

Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August.

"Islamic State militants claim to have killed US journalist James Foley","Militants from Islamic State (Isis) claimed to have killed an American journalist long held captive in Syria in retaliation for ongoing US air strikes against its forces in Iraq.

A propaganda video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Wright Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012.

The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said the slaying came in response to the air strikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago.

Isis, whose chief spokesman came under US state department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder.

Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime.

Foley’s mother later released a statement saying her son gave his life to expose the suffering of the Syrian people. Diane Foley asked his kidnappers to release their other captives.

“He was an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she said.

“We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.

“We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.”

YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it.

Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, said the video appeared to be genuine, and that the killer could well be a Briton.

He said that although further analysis would need to be carried out, the man “on the face of it appears to have been a British person” and that this would not be surprising given the “significant number” of Britons fighting with Isis in Syria and Iraq.

Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity.

A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.”

In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.”

Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement.

A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.”

Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August. Most of the strikes have come in the past few days, near the dam. The other strikes have occurred either to blunt an Isis advance on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil or to lift an Isis siege on Mount Sinjar, where it chased thousands of Iraqi Yazidis whom it threatened to kill unless they converted to Islam. The US considers the siege broken.","1"
"Obama: murder of James Foley 'shocks the conscience of the entire world'","President Barack Obama denounced Islamic State (Isis) militants for murdering an American journalist in retaliation for US air strikes in Iraq, showing an anger he has rarely displayed in remarks about the Iraq conflict.

“No just god would stand for what they did yesterday and every single day,” Obama said Wednesday in brief remarks from Edgerton, Massachusetts, where he is vacationing.

Hours after US intelligence authenticated a gruesome Isis videotape showing the execution of captive journalist James Foley, an act committed with the goal of deterring future US strikes on Isis, Obama said that Isis “has no place in the 21st century,” and called on allies to help defeat a “cancer so it does not spread.”

Obama did not announce any intensification of his bombing campaign, now in its thirteenth day. US Central Command has yet to announce any new strikes since the Tuesday appearance of the social-media-borne Foley video, although sporadic reports from Iraq have indicated some may have taken place Wednesday.

An emotional Obama ran through a litany of Isis human-rights abuses, from rape to enslavement, calling them “cowardly acts of violence.” In a vague reference to Americans held captive by Isis or near its path in Iraq, Obama said the US would “do everything we can to protect our people,” a formulation that has preceded US military action in the past.

With the death of the first American in Iraq since the US military withdrew in 2011, pressure is mounting on Obama to expand his already growing and amorphous air war against Isis.

The stated purpose of nearly two weeks of bombing has moved from the rescue of mostly Yazidi Iraqi civilians at risk of genocide to providing air cover for Kurdish and Iraqi forces wresting the strategically vital Mosul Dam away from Isis. Aides to Obama pointed out from the start that threats to critical infrastructure would likely prompt a US reprisal.

Buffeted between calls to destroy Isis and criticism of their shifting rationale, Obama and the Pentagon have strenuously objected to a charge of mission creep. They point out the consistency of the goals Obama has articulated since 8 August: preventing humanitarian catastrophe and protecting US personnel in Iraq.

Yet both are broad enough to encompass aerial protection of Iraqi Kurdistan and the destruction of Isis vehicles, artillery and fixed positions from Mount Sinjar to the Mosul Dam. The murder of Foley – delivered after he gave a statement at knifepoint blaming the US for his death – and Isis’s threat to kill another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, is also testing Obama’s goal of safeguarding US nationals in a country overrun by Isis.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Wednesday that the video showed both Foley and Sotloff.

Leaders from the UK, France and other countries lined up to excoriate Isis for the slaying. British prime minister David Cameron called it “shocking” and cut short his summer holiday to chair meetings on a response. A particularly acute concern for the UK government is the British accent heard from Foley’s masked killer. US intelligence believes hundreds of westerners, including Americans, have joined Isis.

In the UK, Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, SO15, launched an investigation into the video as leading linguistics experts said the man sounded like he was from London or the south-east of England.

The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said of the video: “All the hallmarks point to it being genuine. We’re very concerned by the apparent fact that the murderer in question is British and we are urgently investigating – agencies on both sides of the Atlantic – are first of all looking to authenticate the video, to make sure that it is genuine, and sadly it appears to be, and then to see if we can identify the individual in question.”

A spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel called Foley’s murder barbaric. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said it exposed Isis as the “caliphate of barbarism”. French president Francois Hollande told Le Monde that a global effort “beyond the traditional debate of intervention or non-intervention” was necessary to confront Isis, and proposed an international meeting next month.

With a brutality so severe it prompted al-Qaida to divorce it from the terrorist franchise, Isis has fulfilled a jihadist aspiration to carve out a state. It flies a flag, sets up internal police to govern its subjects’ adherence to its interpretation of Islamic laws and customs, and maintains financial viability through the control of seized oil assets. While other jihadist entities employ terrorist and insurgent tactics, for which infiltration of another’s populace is central, Isis has mustered a highly mobile army that seizes and holds territory.

Foley’s killer emphasized in a propaganda video that Isis is a state, not a terrorist group, a distinction that is fundamental to the group’s prestige. On Wednesday, Obama repeatedly called Isis “terrorists.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists said the murder of Foley, 40, who went missing during a reporting trip to Syria in 2012, “sickens all decent people”.

“Foley went to Syria to show the plight of the Syrian people, to bear witness to their fight, and in so doing to fight for press freedom,” Sandra Mims Rowe, the group’s chair, said in a statement.

In a Facebook message attributed to her, Foley’s mother Diane said: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.” She also asked the media and the public to respect her family’s privacy.

Obama hailed Foley, who he called Jim, and said he had called Foley’s parents.

Foley’s murder, Obama said, was “an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world.”","1"
"ISIL Claims to Behead an American Photojournalist","A video posted by ISIL terrorists on Tuesday purported to the show the beheading of an American photojournalist who has been missing since 2012. The group claims the beheading is a message to President Obama to end the American intervention in Iraq. The incident is reminiscent of the murder of journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002. Pearl was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, taken hostage and killed by Al-Qaeda.  

James Foley was a photojournalist who has worked for a variety of news organizations. He was working for GlobalPost when he went missing while covering the conflict in Syria in 2012. His disappearance was ruled a kidnapping by the FBI. Before Foley was killed, he was forced to give an anti-American speech. 

In the video, the group also shows journalist Steven Joel Soltoff, a journalist who worked for Time, The National Interest, and Media Line. He last tweeted on August 3, 2013. Soltoff went missing on August 4, 2013 outside of Aleppo, Syria. His family was aware of the situation and was advised not to publicize the information for his safety. He was held in Raqqa. 

This new information may indicate that Foley was detained by the Syrian government alongside Soltoff in 2013. GlobalPost's CEO Phil Balboni gave this comment in May 2013 to NPR, ""Jim [Foley] is now being held by the Syrian government in a detention facility in the Damascus area. We further believe that the facility is under the control of the Syrian air force intelligence service. Based on what we have learned it is likely that Jim is being held with one or more Western journalists, including most likely at least one other American journalist."" At that time, Balboni would not disclose the name, or names, of the ""other American journalist"" citing a ""sensitive and complex"" situation. If this is the case, it is unclear how Foley and Soltoff changed hands from the Syrian government to ISIL.

ISIL claims that Sotloff’s life “depends on Obama’s next decision,"" specifically if the United States continues attacking them in Iraq.

(Note: Just after 6 p.m., @zaidbenjamin was suspended from Twitter. Benjamin was the first prominent Twitter account to share images of Foley's death (the image of Foley after the beheading was censored by Benjamin.) At 6:30 p.m., his account was reactivated. )

The location at which the beheading took place is unknown. Zaid Benjamin, Radio Sawa's Washington Correspondent, has speculated that the executioner's (pictured left) accent indicates he is North African, rather than Iraqi or Syrian. Richard Venalls, a journalist with the Press Association, believes the accent is British, specifically from the South East/Greater London area. Michael Weiss of Interpret Mag also pegged the accent as British. 

The video of the beheading was posted on ISIL's go-to media outlet, AlFurqan Media and on YouTube. It was quickly removed from YouTube as ""a violation of YouTube's policy on violence."" The video remains on AlFurqan. The site been loading extremely slowly as users watch the tragic incident. It was uploaded to YouTube using RapidLeech, which allows users to download files from blocked websites and upload them elsewhere. 

Remembering James Foley

Almost immediately, tributes began pouring in from Foley's friends and colleagues:



The response

The White House is working to confirm the authenticity of the video, as there are often questions about the validity of these execution videos, and some observers have noted suspicious edits to this video. A U.S. official anonymously told the Associated Press they believe it is, in fact, Foley in the video. White House National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden issued this statement to reporters around 6:15 p.m.:

We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.""

Free James Foley, an organization dedicated to finding him, offered this statement:

We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.""


Foley Family via @flyoverangel.
Diane Foley, his mother, posted this statement on the 'Free James Foley' Facebook:

We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people. 

We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.

We thank Jim for all the joy he gave us. He was an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person. Please respect our privacy in the days ahead as we mourn and cherish Jim.","1"
"Islamic State claims it executed American photojournalist James Foley","The Islamic State militant group claimed Tuesday to have beheaded an American photojournalist in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq.

A video posted on YouTube, later removed, purported to show the execution of James Foley after he recited a statement in which he called the U.S. government “my real killers.” A second prisoner, said to be Steven Joel Sotloff, like Foley an American journalist who disappeared while covering Syria’s civil war, then appears in the video.

The masked executioner, speaking in English with what sounds like a British accent, identifies Sotloff and says that “the life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”

U.S. intelligence officials said they were still evaluating the video and could not immediately authenticate it.

A White House statement said, “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL,” one of several acronyms associated with the militants.

“The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity,” said the statement by National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. “If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

President Obama was briefed on the video aboard Air Force One as he returned to his Martha’s Vineyard vacation and will be updated on further developments, the White House said.

“If true, the murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved,” British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter. His office said Wednesday he was cutting short a family vacation and returning to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria.

In an interview with the BBC, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine.

Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.

“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it with former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.

Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.

Foley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012.

Philip Balboni, GlobalPost’s chief executive and co-founder, said in a statement: “On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim’s possible execution first broke. We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic. Until we have that determination, we will not be in a position to make any further statement. We ask for your prayers for Jim and his family.”

In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foley’s mother appeared to accept that the video was authentic. “We have never been prouder of our son Jim,” Diane Foley wrote. “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.

“We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”

Praising James Foley as “an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected.

Sotloff, a freelancer who worked for several news organizations, disappeared in Syria in August 2013.

In addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012, according to a 2013 GlobalPost article. No one has claimed to be holding them.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66 journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda.

The Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.

As the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States.

In April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the group’s control.

This month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.

On Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil.

Within hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes. “We will drown all of you in blood,” it said.

The title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites.

A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,” the masked man says.

The video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” he says. He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq.”

The prisoner also appeals to “my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force,” to “think about what you are doing.”

“I wish I had more time,” he says. “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t an American.”

The masked man then identifies the prisoner as “James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.” He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner; the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its chest.

The masked man then appears with another prisoner, identified as Sotloff, in a similar kneeling position.

Foley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi. According to Global­Post, two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver-colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012.

Since then, Global­Post “has mounted an extensive international investigation . . . to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held,” Global­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday.

"Obama denounces killing of journalist James Foley and pledges ‘justice’","President Obama said Wednesday that the United States “will be vigilant and we will be relentless” against Islamic State militants and would “do what’s necessary to see that justice is done” following the videotaped execution of an American journalist.

“Today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIL,” Obama said, using one of several acronyms for the group. The militants, who posted the video on YouTube Tuesday, said Foley’s killing was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq.

Obama, who spoke Wednesday morning to Foley’s parents, offered no new policy measures to confront Islamic State. Referring to neighboring countries and U.S. allies, he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread.”

Asked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes, one U.S. official said the “only question is if we do more.” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month.

Obama could face pressure to escalate the air campaign in Iraq and increase support to U.S.-backed rebels in Syria who are fighting against the Islamic Front, as well as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U.S. heavy weapons, including portable surface-to-air missiles, as well as for American air support.

In a statement issued after the president’s remarks, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, “We must get serious about confronting this force, including by aggressively arming those battling it.”

The White House confirmed early Wednesday that U.S. intelligence had deemed the video authentic. Obama spoke in Martha’s Vineyard, where he is vacationing with his family.

Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native and a photojournalist working for the Boston-based Web site Global­Post, was kidnapped in northern Syria nearly two years ago while covering the civil war in Syria.

In Britain Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria, amid indications that a British citizen was involved in Foley’s killing. In the video, his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent.

After beheading Foley, the executioner is pictured with a second captive, identified as U.S. freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff, who disappeared last year in Syria. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the executioner says.

"The “Flood Libel” Propagandists of 2015","The proliferation of online news outlets has democratized newsgathering, but it’s also updated the famous adage that “there’s a sucker born every minute” for the Internet age. And no circus attracts the suckers quite like the Arab-Israeli conflict. Not only will people believe anything about Israel; their editors will let them write it. And as we learned yesterday, pretty much every year someone will fall for the impossibly preposterous accusation known as the “flood libel.”

There are moments when biased coverage of Israel goes beyond mere opinion. Last year, the good folks at Vox, a notoriously error-ridden site, declared the existence of a bridge connecting the West Bank and Gaza. It was not a maddening mistake; it was, rather, kind of endearing. It was adorable, in its own way. But that such a bridge does not exist is an easily verifiable fact.

Same goes for New York Times Jerusalem bureau chief Jodi Rudoren’s claim in 2012 that prospective Jewish construction in the West Bank would bisect the West Bank and make physical contiguity impossible. As was subsequently pointed out (and corrected accordingly), this was not even close to being true and Rudoren would have known as much had she glanced at a map.

And this week we were treated to another version of this story, though it’s one we hear often enough. It’s a bit of a hazing ritual: the Palestinians find someone they haven’t yet sold this particular lie to and watch the magic unfold. The lie is this: that flooding in Gaza was caused by Israel opening dams in the South. Easily the most important part of this story is the fact that there are no such dams. They are the Gaza-West Bank bridge of this story. And yet, the story just keeps appearing because the Palestinians never run out of Western suckers.

One of the suckers this year was Vice News. To try to hide its ignorance, Vice offered up several paragraphs of false accusations from the Palestinians followed by this attempt at “balance”: “Israeli officials categorically denied they were to blame while speaking to VICE News on Monday.”

Other outlets were more honest and ethical in the aftermath of publishing the flood libel. As HonestReporting notes, the Daily Mail went with a bit of false balance but also, crucially, added a straight correction and admission of error: “An earlier version of this article stated that Israel had opened river dams in the south of the country, causing flooding in the Gaza strip. In fact, there are no dams in southern Israel and the flooding was caused by rain and drainage issues. We are happy to clarify this.”

According to HonestReporting, the Daily Mail piece also contained the following amazing sentence: “The flooding was today compounded after an Israeli power company cut electricity to two of Gaza’s major West Bank cities.”

And according to CAMERA, both Agence France Presse and Al Jazeera (shocking, I know) passed along the flood libel. AFP pulled its video, and Al Jazeera went the Vice route by pretending the existence of magical dams is somehow in dispute.

The flood libel is proof that sometimes people refuse to learn from others’ mistakes. See this post from Jonathan Tobin in December 2013 for a reminder that the flood libel is neither new nor surprising. IDF spokeswoman Libby Weiss understandably would rather news organizations first locate their unicorns before blaming those unicorns for goring the neighbor’s ox:


So why does this keep happening? Part of the frustration with reporters stems from their absolute laziness. The Internet has put so much information within arm’s reach, and yet reporters are taught that when it comes to Israel, the facts are optional. And that’s because the facts favor Israel.

If you were to draw a map of Israel, using Western news organizations’ reporting, you’d have one that showed Israel bisecting the West Bank while connecting it to Gaza via a bridge and holding parliamentary meetings in its capital of Tel Aviv. None of that is true, but that’s the picture that emerges from the media’s “reporting.”

There also appears to be a kind of modified Stockholm Syndrome at work. These reporters and the outlets they represent are constantly made to look like fools by Palestinian propaganda. But they also seem not to mind, because they sympathize so strongly with what the propagandists and terrorists are telling them.

If what I’m describing to you sounds an awful lot like an activist, not a journalist, well–that’s about right. And such activists play a key role in disseminating grist for the anti-Semitic mill. The first headline is the one that makes waves, especially in the Arab world and in Europe. If the follow-up is not a full retraction or correction, but rather a “balanced” piece in which Israel is permitted to deny the existence of things that plainly don’t exist, then it casts the Israeli government as a powerful entity engaged in a cover-up.

It would be bad enough if we were forced to admit that our media just can’t get the story right. But that’s naïve. The truth is, much of the time our media just won’t get it right. And that’s why the flood libel returns, year after year.","1"
"Israel denies causing Gaza floods by opening dams","Israel has rejected allegations by government officials in the Gaza strip that authorities were responsible for released storm waters flooding parts of the besieged area.

""Due to the recent rain, streams were flooded throughout the region with no connection to actions taken by the State of Israel.""

"Italian fisherman catches monstrous 280-pound catfish","Italian fisherman Dino Ferrari landed what could potentially be a world record wels catfish in Italy’s Po Delta. Ferrari’s fish measured an incredible 8.7 feet in length and weighed 280 pounds. The current weight record for a wels catfish is over 300 pounds, but according to the Daily Mirror, Ferrari may have set a record for the largest catfish to be caught with a rod and reel.

Here’s photographic proof that this thing could just swallow an adult if it wanted to. It’s enormous.

""It was a fight that lasted 40 minutes,"" says Dino. Before now no one had ever managed to capture a prey so great with the technique of spinning, a type of fishing with artificial bait. When they felt the appropriate time, have pulled it towards the boat and then, with great difficulty by the torpedo, they hooked and towed to shore. Although destroyed by fatigue are happy for the company: the brothers win it a mention in the Guinness Book of Records. ""To fish these giants of the river, you must have patience but also a lot of physical strength,"" says the fisherman. In truth, the two are quite well-known in the catfish fishing for making other exceptional catches in the past: ""In 20 years we have caught about 1,800."" The joy for this sensational blow was so great that Dino wanted to embrace the mighty fish for the usual photos. It is thought that the torpedo can achieve even four feet long, although so far there is no evidence. And the prey, what happened? The giant is still in the Po. After a few shots have thrown back into the water. ""Who am I to take his life?"" Says Dino Ferrari. Maybe in a year will be able to catch them again. However, at that point it will be even more gigantic","1"
"Giant 8ft 9in catfish weighing 19 stone caught in Italy is thought to be the biggest ever reeled in with a rod and line","A fisherman has caught a giant 8ft 9in long catfish weighing 19 stone - and it could be the biggest ever caught with the humble rod and line.

Dino Ferrari hooked the huge wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy.

The cannibalistic wels catfish, also known as the sheatfish, is native to Europe and can grow as long as 13ft and up to 62st - but it is exceedingly rare to catch one that is over two metres long.

Dino Ferrari hooked the huge wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy

But while Mr Ferrari's fish might set a new record for the biggest ever caught on a line, it is not the heaviest ever hooked - that award goes to catfish which weighed 22st and was 9ft long, and was caught in the Po Delta, reports The Mirror.

In December schoolboy Sam Lee, 14, caught an 8ft 14 stone catfish while on a fishing holiday in Spain with his father Peter.

The giant catfish immediately bolted 100 metres downstream, but Sam, from Chester, hung on and after a 35 minute battle finally landed the 2.5 metre-long fish.

In time honoured tradition, he then posed for a photo to secure bragging rights before letting the creature swim back into the water at the River Ebro in Catalonia.

Mr Ferrari (pictured) poses with his monster catch. Wels catfish can grow as long as 13ft and weigh up to 62st

In October a Cornish pensioner caught an 8ft-long, 15 stonepart-albino catfish, thought to be the biggest of its kind ever caught.

The aptly named Tom Herron, 68, from Launceston, battled the cream-coloured monster fish in the River Segre, Mequinenza, Spain, for 40 minutes before finally hauling it in.

The wels catfish is scaleless and lives in fresh and brackish water.

It is recognisable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth.

The wels catfish can live for thirty years and live off annelid worms, gastropods, insects, crustaceans and fish including other catfish; the larger ones also eat frogs, mice, rats, and even ducks.

Recently, wels catfish have been spotted in non-native habitats lunging out of the water to grab pigeons on land.","1"
"Italian catches huge wels catfish; is it a record?","Italian fisherman Dino Ferrari, an expert at catching big wels catfish, outdid himself on Thursday when he landed an enormous 280-pounder in the Po Delta, a part of the famous Po River, the longest river in Italy at more than 400 miles.

The Po River and Delta are known for massive wels catfish, but anything bigger than 6.5 feet is considered extremely rare, and this one measured 8.8 feet.

The U.K. Mirror reported that Ferrari’s fish could possibly be the world’s biggest wels catfish caught with a rod and reel, though records of this sort are difficult to confirm.

The Mirror and NT News reported that the biggest wels catfish ever recorded was a 9.1-footer from the Po Delta, but they differ on its weight—one reporting it as 308 pounds, the other as 317 pounds. The method of that catch is uncertain.

Sportex Italia, Ferrari’s sponsor, called his fish the “world record spinning torpedo,” which might mean it’s a world record for a Torpedo spinning rod made by an Italian manufacturer, though it also simply says it’s a “world record in the spin fishing for catfish.”

Regardless, Ferrari’s fish is one of the biggest wels catfish recorded in recent history.

The wels catfish is the second-largest freshwater fish in its region, ranking behind the beluga sturgeon. The largest beluga sturgeon on record is reportedly 3,463 pounds.

Ferrari told GrindTV that the fish took an artificial bait on the surface, and the fight from a boat lasted 40 minutes.

The best part about Ferrari’s catch is that after he and his brother, Dario, weighed the fish, they released it back into the delta so it could fight again another day.

"Enormous 20-stone catfish caught with fishing rod in Italy after 40-minute boat battle","The wels catfish, which was set free, could be one of the largest ever caught

An enormous catfish weighing 20 stone has been caught in Italy using only a fishing rod.

Dino Ferrari told GrindTV that he and his brother, Dario, lured it in with artificial bait and then battled the giant fish from their small boat for 40 minutes on Thursday.

After staying in the water to weigh and measure the specimen, which is one of the largest ever caught, they released it back into the river to swim another day.

Rod manufacturer Sportex Italia, which sponsors Mr Ferrari, claimed that the 2.67m wels catfish was a world record size to be caught with its Torpedo spinning rod.

It was found in the Po Delta, which is known for having the perfect living conditions for giant wels to flourish.

According to a British wels catfish website, they have hundreds “velcro-like teeth” used to hold prey before passing food to “crushing pads” at the back of the throat.

It records the UK record dating back to 1997 as a four-and-a-half stone fish caught in Bedfordshire.

The fish are not fussy eaters and have reportedly been known to feed on ducks, rats and even pigeons.","1"
"280 Pound Catfish: Fisherman Makes Huge Catch In Italy, Catfish Could Set Record","A 280 pound catfish was caught by a fisherman in Italy. According to USA Today Sports, Dino Ferrari caught the huge fish in Po Delta. While the catfish caught by Ferrari was 8.7 feet in length and weighed 280 pounds, the largest catfish ever caught weighed 300 pounds. That does not mean that this wasn’t a record-breaking fish, however. According to the report, this might be the largest catfish ever caught using a generic fishing rod.

According to the San Antonio Express-News, any catfish over 6.5 feet is considered extremely rare. Ferrari isn’t some small time fisherman, either. According to Grind TV, the Italy native is a pro at catching big Wels catfish, and many of these fish frequent the waters where Ferrari casts his line.

“The wels catfish is the second-largest freshwater fish in its region, ranking behind the beluga sturgeon. The largest beluga sturgeon on record is reportedly 3,463 pounds.”

The 280 pound catfish is certainly a sight to see, as it looks as if it could swallow Ferrari whole. He posed for photos with the fish, clearly very proud of his catch (even appearing to hug it while his brother took some pictures), which took him a tiring 40 minutes to reel in. It is almost hard to believe that catfish can get that big!

Animal lovers may be happy to know that Ferrari did not keep the catfish, nor did he sell it for money. After his brother took a couple of pictures of the creature, the guys released it back into the river, where it swam off, happy to live another day.

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, these Wels catfish aren’t exactly harmless; this certainly is not the type of sea creature that you would want to swim into. And it is definitely not a “gentle giant” by any means.

“Dino’s monster catch is not the sort of fish you’d want to accidentally swim into while skinny dipping. The fish has a ferocious appetite and will consume anything that happens to cross its path. These surly catfish have even been filmed eating pigeons after our feathery friends happened to fly too close to these cold-blooded killers.”

Pictures of the 280 pound catfish are making waves on the internet today. Have you ever seen a catfish so big? Would you want to see a Wels catfish in person?

A fisherman has reeled in a monster 19 stone catfish, which could be the biggest in the world caught with a rod and reel.

Dino Ferrari hooked the whopper wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy.

While the fish might set a new record for the biggest caught on a line, it is far from the heaviest ever landed. The biggest was 22st and 2.78m long, and was also from the Po Delta.

Wels catfish can grow as long as 4m and up to 62st. However, it is rare to catch one that is over two meters long.

Believed to be one of the largest of its kind ever caught, the creature was pulled from the river on Feb 19 with a rod and line after a battle lasting 40 minutes.

The nine foot-long creature, a wels catfish, has been dubbed “the monster of the Po” by the Italian media.

The fish was released after the trophy photos (Sportex Italia)

After catching, weighing and photographing it, the brothers released it back into the river, which flows across northern Italy to the Adriatic.

“It’s a silurus glanis [the Latin name for the species],” Dino Ferrari said. “The American catfish doesn’t grow to such large dimensions – at most it can weigh 50kg.” He estimated the fish to be about 30 years old, based on its size, adding that the species can live for up to 50 years.

“They don’t range over very large distances, they tend to live in the same stretch of river, moving just a few kilometres either way. They eat all types of fish.

""To catch them you need a lot of patience but also physical strength. We fought for 40 minutes to reel it in. We tired it out and then lifted it out of the water.”

The wels catfish, also known as the sheatfish, lives in fresh and brackish water.

It is native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia but was introduced to western Europe.

The fish prey on other fish, as well as worms, crustaceans, frogs and water fowl.

“Who knows, maybe we will manage to catch it again in a year’s time, and it will be even more gigantic,” said Mr Ferrari.","1"

Surprisingly, it’s not the heaviest or longest catfish ever caught on a rod and line. The Mirror reports a 9-foot, 308-pound catfish was previously caught in the Po Delta.

Wels catfish can apparently grow to be over 13 feet long and nearly 900 pounds, but it’s rare to catch one over about 6 feet.

It was all a hoax. Judd Nelson is not dead. The fake news site even created an elaborate story surrounding Judd Nelson’s alleged death, writing that the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner was trying to determine his cause of death as investigators attempted to rule out foul play. In a report called “BREAKING: “Brat Pack” Judd Nelson Found Dead in Los Angeles Condo,” the hoaxer wrote the following untrue tale of Nelson’s demise.

“Multiple unconfirmed reports say Nelson was found dead Saturday evening in his Los Angeles condo, Sierra Towers after police responded to a 911 call for an unconscious man around 9:25 p.m. Although police have not yet released the man’s identity, multiple occupants of the 31-story West Hollywood high-rise have confirmed that it was Nelson’s condo police responded to and a single body was carried out of the apartment on a stretcher.”

Judd Nelson doesn’t even live in a Los Angeles condo located in a 31-story West Hollywood high-rise building. That little detail was fabricated along with the news of his death.

The actor’s agent and his manager both confirmed that the news of his death was premature. Agent Gregg Klein even visited Nelson to snap a photo of the 55-year-old actor, producer and screenwriter clutching a copy of today’s newspaper in his hands, according to Los Angeles Times. As visible in the photo at the top of the page, the actor is still alive. Klein forwarded a copy of the pic to Los Angeles Times along with a message that was short and to the point.

“Reports of Judd Nelson’s death are not accurate please see attached photo.”

Nelson’s manager, Jean-Pierre Henraux, also confirmed that the actor was a victim of a death hoax, calling his condition “perfect” and noting that he recently filmed an episode of the upcoming television series Empire, a family drama set in a hip-hop empire. The show’s stars include Terrence Howard, Taraji P. Henson, Jim Cantafio and Jackie Dallas.

As proof of life, Judd Nelson even offered a photo of himself holding the day’s Los Angeles Times.

The fake news site even created an elaborate story surrounding Judd Nelson’s alleged death, writing that the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner was trying to determine his cause of death as investigators attempted to rule out foul play. In a report called “BREAKING: “Brat Pack” Judd Nelson Found Dead in Los Angeles Condo,” the hoaxer wrote the following untrue tale of Nelson’s demise.

“Multiple unconfirmed reports say Nelson was found dead Saturday evening in his Los Angeles condo, Sierra Towers after police responded to a 911 call for an unconscious man around 9:25 p.m. Although police have not yet released the man’s identity, multiple occupants of the 31-story West Hollywood high-rise have confirmed that it was Nelson’s condo police responded to and a single body was carried out of the apartment on a stretcher.”

The actor doesn’t even live in a Los Angeles condo located in a 31-story West Hollywood high-rise building. That little detail was fabricated along with the news of his death. That’s what prompted Judd Nelson to offer proof of life that he was still among the living. He is.

The actor’s agent and his manager both confirmed that the news of his death was premature. Agent Gregg Klein even visited Nelson to snap a photo of the 55-year-old actor, producer and screenwriter clutching a copy of today’s newspaper in his hands, according to Los Angeles Times. As visible in the photo at the top of the page, the actor is still alive. Klein forwarded a copy of the Judd Nelson proof of life pic to Los Angeles Times along with a message that was short and to the point.

“Reports of Judd Nelson’s death are not accurate please see attached photo.”

Nelson’s manager, Jean-Pierre Henraux, also confirmed that the actor was a victim of a death hoax, calling his condition “perfect” and noting that he recently filmed an episode of the upcoming television series Empire, a family drama set in a hip-hop empire. The show’s stars include Terrence Howard, Taraji P. Henson, Jim Cantafio and Jackie Dallas.

As previously reported by The Inquisitr, a cruel death hoax involving Zayn Malik made headlines when it was incorrectly reported that his younger cousin had died. Little Arshiya Malik underwent surgery for a brain tumor, and someone on Twitter started #RIP Arshiya, which quickly began trending worldwide. Arshiya is not dead. However, she is very ill, and her family is praying for her recovery.

"Judd Nelson isn't dead; report is a hoax","ports of Judd Nelson’s death have been greatly exaggerated.

Agent Gregg Klein even hustled to Nelson’s home Sunday morning -- which he said is not in the building mentioned in the original false report -- to take a photo of the actor with the front page of today's newspaper.

Klein was to the point when he answered The Times' query about Nelson's status: ""Reports of Judd Nelson's death are not accurate please see attached photo.""","1"

"Fowler Falls For Fake Website, Makes Crazy Claims About Tennis Star","Tonight's Australian Open coverage on ESPN2 featured announcer Chris Fowler explaining to the audience that Japanese pro Kei Nishikori is, among other things, the highest-paid tennis player in the world and the owner of a restaurant chain, a soccer team, and clothing and perfume lines. None of those things are true, and they all come from notorious satire site MediaMass.

Fowler cited Nishikori as having earned $46 million in 2014. The actual number is $11 million, according to Forbes. That makes him the ninth-highest paid player—not the richest.

That's okay, Chris. It happens to the best of us.","1"
"Satire Website Fools ESPN, Kei Nishikori isn't highest paid tennis star","ESPN host Chris Fowler was duped by a fake website, MediaMass, because he failed to check his facts.

Fowler reported a series of wrong facts about Japanese tennis star Kei Nishikori, including that he is the world's highest-paid tennis star and has his own vodka line, soccer team and restaurant chain, USA Today reported. In the segment:

""You're looking at the highest paid tennis player in the male side in the world. That might be a surprise to Roger Federer fans, but Nishikori has signed up lots of companies. According to published reports, made about 46 million last year...How's he doing it? He owns Fat Nishikori burger restaurant, a football team which is soccer, his own brand of vodka, he's got a perfume, he's got a clothing line...He's got a whole lot of deals with Japanese companies.""



Despite Fowler's claim, Deadspin reported, citing Forbes magazine, that Nishikori didn't make $46 million last year but just $11 million, which ""makes him the ninth-highest paid player -- not the richest."" Forbes breaks that down as $9 million in endorsements and $2 million in prize money.

The satire site, Media Mass, had reported that Nishikori was the top paid player making $46 million, based on the (fictional) People with Money magazine.

""He owes his fortune to smart stock investments, substantial property holdings, lucrative endorsement deals with CoverGirl cosmetics. He also owns several restaurants (the “Fat Nishikori Burger” chain) in Tokyo, a Football Team (the “Matsue Angels”), has launched his own brand of Vodka (Pure Wondernishikori - Japan), and is tackling the juniors market with a top-selling perfume (With Love from Kei) and a fashion line called “Kei Nishikori Seduction,'"" Media Mass reported.

Within the article, however, in red letters, was a note saying the story was false, linking to a 2012 page describing Media Mass's project. The update, which iMediaEthics highlighted below, says it was posted Jan. 25, 2015, but it was posted when iMediaEthics viewed the story Jan. 24, so we are unsure when it was published.


 

That update linked to a page on Media Mass' website. ""The website mediamass.net is the medium of our satire to expose with humour, exaggeration and ridicule the contemporary mass production and mass consumption that we observe,"" Media Mass' website states.

In ESPN's defense,  USA Today noted, ""None of the information was completely absurd — it’s not as if they said he owned four castles or slept upside down in a hyperbaric chamber or plans on being one of those people who want to take a one-way trip to Mars.""

Fowler apologized for the error on Twitter, Sports Grid noted.

"Sorry, KFC isn't going to be selling weed in Colorado restaurants","At least not anytime soon

The internet has been salivating at the prospect of getting stoned and eating fried chicken this week, after reports circulated that KFC is to become a marijuana dispensary as well as a restaurant.

A story on Racket Report claimed that with tax revenue from sales of the drug being so high in Colorado, KFC wanted a piece of the action, with the added benefit that its chicken would see a boost in sales thanks to the munchies.

It looks to be false for several reasons however:

- Racket Report has carried a lot of hoax stories in the past

- KFC hasn't mentioned marijuana on its official news page

- Marijuana sales are currently cash only which would make things tricky for the chain

- Marijuana is still in somewhat of a legal grey area and probably not crystal clear enough for a giant brand to start slinging it

- KFC doesn't even sell alcohol, so they'd really be jumping in at the deep end

While weed might not be hitting KFC any time soon, with sweeping legalisation in the US this sort of thing is inevitable.

Only yesterday, Ben & Jerry's said they'd be up for creating cannabis-infused ice-cream once it's completely legal.

Update: KFC confirmed it. Not happening.","1"
"KFC Marijuana Sales To Begin In Colorado? It’s Unbelievable — Literally","KFC: Marijuana on the menu? Not likely. A story that began circulating on Tuesday afternoon created a bit of a frenzy, but the fact is, there’s no sign KFC will really be selling marijuana in its stores.

The story began at the Racket Report, where it was announced that marijuana profits were hitting such high levels that the fast food restaurant chain had decided to get in on the game. While the idea may appeal to pot lovers who think they can get the munchies and a bucket full of munchables in a single stop, there are a few problems.

First and foremost, Racket Report appears to be a mostly satirical website, carrying multiple stories, such as the Fetal Ink Syndrome story, that have been debunked by fact-checking site Snopes. (Here‘s Snopes debunking the Fetal Ink Syndrome tale.)

KFC also doesn’t mention any marijuana sales on its official news page — a thing you’d think they’d mention if they were hoping to drum up sales.

Another concern is banking. While marijuana shops were assured early in 2014 that they could have access to banks, many report still having difficulties. Though the original story claims that KFC’s pot sales will be cash only, in order to protect the restaurant’s funds, this would be no protection.

If marijuana sales are understood to be federally illegal (a question that is in limbo at the moment, with government officials calling on law enforcement to make pot arrests a very low priority, but laws still on the books) then no funds collected by a facility could reasonably be protected. That is, if the government elected to seize funds illegally procured, they could still freeze bank accounts and seize the contents — even if all illegal dealings were handled in cash.

This could not only be a concern for KFC, but for its parent company, YUM Brands.

Notably, a KFC turned into a marijuana dispensary is a plot point in a South park episode, and there is another KFC that does indeed sell marijuana — but it’s not the fried chicken chain. Instead, it’s a shop called Kind For Cures, a California pot shop based on that same South Park episode, that assures on its website, “This ain’t no chicken joint!”

Calls to YUM Brands and to KFC Tuesday evening were not immediately returned, but there are no signs that KFC marijuana will be available in the bucket next to your extra crispy any time soon.

"Jordan’s King Abdullah Did Not Personally Fly Airstrikes On ISIS","Jordan’s King Abdullah announced he was cutting short a visit to the U.S. following the brutal death of a Jordanian fighter pilot captured by ISIS with this photo.

The king, a former military pilot himself, joined Jordanian leaders in calling Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh, who was burned alive, a martyr. The government also vowed revenge and an “earth-shaking” response.  facebook.com

It made a great story, but it wasn’t true, the Jordanian government said. Airstrikes did hit targets in Syria, but the king was not in the pilot’s seat.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told CNN Thursday the rumors of the king personally launching airstrikes on ISIS targets were “creative,” but untrue.

Actually, the king was involved in some more conventional leadership. He met with officials and security leaders.

"No, Jordan's King Abdullah II is not personally flying planes against Isis","A Jordanian government spokesman has denied rumours that the Jordanian King Abdullah II, a trained pilot, is personally conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State (Isis).

Mohammed al-Momani said in a statement that reports about the personal involvement of the King in combat missions on IS targets is unfounded and baseless.

Rumours on King Abdullah spread after the he promised to fight back hard against IS, saying that the death of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh ""will not be in vain"".

""We are waging this war to protect our faith, our values and human principles and our war for their sake will be relentless and will hit them in their own ground,"" he said on state television.

Momani had revealed earlier that Jordan will intensify its efforts with an US-led coalition against IS.

Later on Wednesday, Abdullah vowed ""relentless"" war against IS, saying Jordan will ""hit them on their own ground"".

Iraqi news outlets cited unofficial sources saying that the king was personally flying a plane. Jordanian author Waleed Abu Anada tweeted:

BREAKING: Local reports here in Jordan say that King Abdullah will personally fly and lead the airstrikes against ISIS tomorrow. #IAmMoath— Waleed Abu Nada (@waleedabunada) February 4, 2015

Before becoming king, Abdullah II was a general in charge of Jordanian special forces and a certified Cobra Helicopter pilot. In 1980 he joined the UK's Royal military academy Sandhurst.

After the barbaric video of Kasasbeh burning to death emerged, The Royal Hashemite Court's Facebook page published a picture of the King in pilot gear:

The picture was retweeted several times and used by some as a proof that the Jordanian king was gearing up to fight IS in person.

"Rumors of King Abdullah Flying in Airstrikes Not True, Fox Excited Anyway","Fox & Friends got very excited Thursday morning over rumors, which they credited to Jordanian TV, that King Abdullah of Jordan had potentially participated in retaliatory airstrikes against ISIS after the immolation death of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasaesbeh.

“What a statement that would make,” Steve Doocy said.

“He is stepping up with strong leadership and clarity,” Elisabeth Hasselbeck said. “What is our president doing?

The photos were eventually revealed to be from a video last year in which Abdullah took several young cancer patients on a flight. Doocy acknowledged the photos were old before adding, “But he is a pilot.”

Alas, no hero warrior head of state today:

Photos of Jord King RT'ed from @KsaBrk appear to be old and misleading. Arabic reports of a planned attack are numerous but unverifiable. — Joseph Braude (@josephbraude) February 5, 2015

From @RenaNetjes, Arabic press reports of Jordanian king's flight sortie have been denied by an official spokesperson. @deborahamos — Joseph Braude (@josephbraude) February 5, 2015

Al Arabiya confirmed that Abdullah did not take part in any air strikes, and contradicted Doocy’s statement that he was a pilot:

Meanwhile, a Jordanian government official on Thursday told Al Arabiya News that King Abdullah was not flying missions against ISIS himself, after local media reports – also taken by some international outlets – indicated he is set to do so. The official also noted that observers should refrain from calling King Abdullah a fighter pilot as he does not officially hold the title. He is, however, the commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Air Force. The king is a trained combatant, part of the parachute brigade and flies civilian planes and helicopters, the official added.

Doocy quietly corrected he record at the end of the next segment. “By the way, I should point out we understand that so far the king has not taken part in any of the raids,” Doocy said. “But he may going forward.” What a statement that would make.

"Korean Housewife’s Hair Sucked Up into Robot Vacuum","SEOUL, Feb. 5 (Korea Bizwire) – A powerful robot vacuum cleaner caused an unlikely accident involving a Korean housewife, and required the intervention of a couple of paramedics. On January 3, a woman in her fifties had her hair sucked up into a robot vacuum at her home in the city of Changwon, South Korea.

On the day of the accident, she turned on her robot vacuum as usual, and laid down flat on the floor to rest, leaving the robot to do its job. The robot vacuum came around her relaxing on the floor, and suddenly sucked her hair into its nozzle. The vacuum stopped running one to two minutes after the sudden hair intake.

The startled housewife called 119, Korea’s emergency telephone number. Fortunately, paramedics quickly arrived at the scene, and successfully disjoined her hair from the nozzle. The housewife suffered only minor injuries.

The problematic robot vacuum had a nozzle with a roller inside, which sweeps and vacuums floors. The Changwon Fire Service Headquarters presumed that the vacuum’s sensors identified the woman’s hair as dust.

The likelihood of this type accident occurring is undoubtedly more significant in countries with a “sitting-on-the-floor” culture. Since Koreans love to rest or relax on a toasty, cleanly swept floor, exercising caution on using a robot vacuum is probably a good idea.","1"

"Robot vacuum cleaner 'attacks' South Korea housewife's hair","A robotic vacuum cleaner ""attacked"" a South Korean woman while she slept by attempting to suck up the hair on her head.

The woman, a 52-year-old resident of Changwon who has not been named, was awoken by the pain and, unable to extricate herself from the robot, called the fire department for help.

She was eventually freed by paramedics, escaping serious injury but losing several strands of hair.

It required two paramedics to remove her hair from the machine's nozzle, Korea Biz Wire reported.

The incident, which took place on January 3, highlighted the potential risk of this type of accident in South Korea, where sitting and sleeping on the floor is common practice.

The vacuum only stopped running more than a minute after initially ingesting the woman's hair.

She was still unable to free herself from the vacuum and made a ""desperate rescue request"" call to 119, South Korea's emergency telephone number.

Robotic vacuum cleaners are equipped with sensors allowing them to clean surfaces by detecting dirt while avoiding obstacles such as stairs, people and cables - but not, seemingly, human hair that is still attached.

Too close to home

While a person's home is his or her castle, it can also the source of seriously painful and embarrassing accidents that require medical attention.

Doctors in Saudi Arabia got quite a shock when they x-rayed a toddler and saw that he had swallowed a metallic SpongeBob SquarePants pendant.

Doctors couldn't believe their eyes when they saw this familiar face on the x-ray

The item, seen in stunning detail in the image above, was removed from the 16-month-old baby boy's oesophagus without complications.

A closer look at the hairball doctors removed Picture: EUROPICS

A teen in Kyrgyzstan was rushed to hospital unable to eat and when doctors cut open the 18-year-old's swollen stomach they discovered this giant hairball, which had formed over many years of the girl compulsively eating her own hair and locks she picked up off the floor.

Statistically speaking, most British people are more likely to be injured at home than anywhere else.

Don't whatever you do, let the kids anywhere near a trampoline, with the device accounting for around half of all domestic sports injuries requiring hospital treatment among children. Safety experts say children jumping on one with an adult or a crowded trampoline, are the most likely to end in tears and a trip to an A&E unit.

Barbequing at home can cause unfortunate accidents, with a quarter of us admitting to cooking with one, that is operating a large open flame, while drunk. Gazebos, wooden furniture and sheds are often accidentally set alight in the warmer months, safety experts say. Tipsy grillers could explain the 2,000 individuals admitted to A&E units each year with barbeque-related injuries.

Depending on the damage, it seems some of us nurse our wounds in silence.

Around a third of UK adults will feel more than a slight ache or pain as a direct result of bedroom antics, with carpet burns, cricked necks and bruised shoulders among the nation's most common sex injuries.

"South Korean woman's hair 'eaten' by robot vacuum cleaner as she slept","When a South Korean woman invested in a robot vacuum cleaner, the idea was to leave her trustworthy gadget to do its work while she took a break from household chores.

Instead, the 52-year-old resident of Changwon city ended up being the victim of what many believe is a peek into a dystopian future in which supposedly benign robots turn against their human masters.

The woman, whose name is being withheld, was taking a nap on the floor at home when the vacuum cleaner locked on to her hair and sucked it up, apparently mistaking it for dust.

The agony of having her hair entangled in the bowels of the contraption roused the woman from her slumber.

Unable to free herself, she called the fire department with a “desperate rescue plea” and was separated from the robot’s clutches by paramedics, according to the South Korean newspaper the Kyunghyang Shinmun.

She escaped serious injury, although it is not known whether she has retained the autonomous cleaner’s services.

Robot vacuum cleaners have grown in popularity in recent years, with US firm iRobot’s circular Roomba selling well over 10 million units in the 12 years since its debut in 2002.

Panasonic recently unveiled Rulo, a triangular rival to Roomba that the Japanese firm says is more adept at sucking up dust from corners.

The wheeled gadgets are equipped with sensors that enable them to steer clear of obstacles, avoid tumbling down stairs, and detect dust and other debris on the floor. They can also be programmed to seek out a recharging dock.

Korean Biz Wire pointed out, however, that people from cultures in which it’s commonplace to sit or nap on the floor - such as Japan and South Korea – may be more vulnerable to vacuum robot rage.","1"
"Rumor Robert Plant Ripped Up $800 Million Contract To Reunite Led Zeppelin Called 'Rubbish'","A rumor that Robert Plant ripped up an $800 million contract offer to reunite Led Zeppelin has been called ""rubbish"" by Plant's publicist.

As reported by the Daily Mirror, Plant, as well as former bandmates Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones, and Jason Bonham, son of the late drummer John Bonham, were offered $800 million by Virgin mogul Sir Richard Branson to perform a 35-date, three-city reunion tour. The story went that while Page, Jones and Bonham reportedly signed up immediately, Plant ripped up the papers right in front of his colleagues. Plant's publicist later debunked the report to The Guardian.

If the news was real, it would have been a treat for Zeppelin fans. Each of the three original members were scheduled to make over $200 million just for performing, and another $100 million in merchandise split between them all. Scheduled to perform in London, Berlin and New Jersey, Branson was preparing to rename one of his jumbo jets ""The Starship,"" in order to fly the band to each of its destinations. He also wanted rebrand the jet's staircase as the ""Stairway to Heaven,"" and had an optional 45-date tour extension should the band agree.

HuffPost Entertainment contacted representatives for Plant and Branson to see if they had any further comment on the story. This post will be updated if and when they provide a response.

For more, head to The Guardian.","1"
"It's 'rubbish' that Robert Plant turned down £500m Led Zeppelin reformation offer, says publicist","Robert Plant’s publicist has described as “rubbish” a Daily Mirror report that he rejected a £500m Led Zeppelin reunion. The paper claims Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones had both signed on for the tour deal, bankrolled by Richard Branson, which would have featured John Bonham’s son Jason on drums.

Branson had proposed 35 concerts spanning just three cities, according to the Mirror. The band would fly from London to Berlin to New Jersey in a specially outfitted jet: Branson wanted to recreate The Starship, from Led Zep’s heyday, selling tickets for the plane’s back rows at £100,000 per seat.

“Branson tried to pull out all of the stops,” claimed the Mirror’s source, who claimed it was enough to convince Page, Jones, and Bonham to reprise their 2007 Celebration Day show, and that the band was even considering a further 45-night tour across five more venues. “But even [Branson’s] money was not enough to get Plant to sign up,” the source said. “[He] asked for 48 hours to think about it,” then ripped up the contract in front of a group of promoters. “His mind is made up and that’s that.”

Rumours were rife earlier this year that Zeppelin would be reforming, and Page seemed newly furious at his former bandmate. “Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band,” Page said. “[Robert]’s just playing games, and I’m fed up with it, to be honest with you.”

At the end of September, Page said a reunion was no longer “a possibility or on the cards”. He told journalists at an event to promote the reissues of Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy: “I’m not going to give a detail-by-detail account of what one person says or another person says, so there’s not much more I can say about that.” The guitarist explained that he is instead planning to revisit Led Zeppelin material on a 2015 solo tour.

This story was amended on 10 November, following a comment from Robert Plant’s publicist","1"
"No, Robert Plant Didn’t Rip Up an $800 Million Contract","Led Zeppelin fans will be disappointed to learn that there’s no reunion tour and a story that appeared in the Daily Mirror suggesting that Robert Plant ripped up an $800 contract for such a gig is false, according to the Guardian.

The reported tour was supposedly financed by Virgin founder Richard Branson, who wanted to turn one of his Virgin planes into a new iteration of “The Starship,” the jet​ the band used to tour in the 1970s. The group was to play 35 dates in three locales-- London, Berlin and New Jersey.

Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones had signed on. And the late drummer John Bonham’s son Jason was to play drums for the band. “It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,” a source told the Daily Mirror. “When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

Turns out, the entire tale is “rubbish,” said Plant’s publicist to the Guardian, backing up what Page had said to the publication in September - a Zeppelin reunion was “[not] very likely.”","1"
"That powerful Lego letter to parents from the 1970s? It's real","A powerful message from Lego to parents from 1974 went viral over the weekend - and now the company has confirmed that it is indeed authentic.

Speaking to i100.co.uk, Emma Owen of Lego UK and Ireland said the letter was part of a pamphlet showing a variety of Lego doll house products targeted at girls aged four and up from the 1970s.

Commenting on the message, fryd_ first said “it seems like we’ve taken a step backwards” in forty years but Lego disagree.

The text remains relevant to this day – our focus has always been, and remains to bring creative play experiences to all children in the world, based on the Lego brick and the Lego system – ultimately enabling children to build and create whatever they can imagine.

Emma Owens of Lego
The letter from 1974 in full:

To Parents

The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.

It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.

A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.

The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

It’s not the first time an old message from Lego has gone viral. This 1981 advert from the company was aimed at all children and shared widely online in January 2014.
