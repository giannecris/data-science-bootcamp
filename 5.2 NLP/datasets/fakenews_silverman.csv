"AUSTRALIA: 600-POUND WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO 40-POUND BABY","Perth | A 600-pound woman has given birth to a 40-pound baby at Perth’s King Edward Memorial Hospital, a record breaking weight that could possibly make the newborn the largest baby ever born, reports the Western Australian Herald this morning.
The baby of gigantic size surprised doctors and staff members who were not fully prepared for such an event but miraculously managed to give birth to the 40-pound (18 kilos) baby who remains in a healthy state, has confirmed a hospital spokesman.

The single mother who’s delivery necessitated a surgical incision in the mother’s abdomen and uterus was done to prevent any harm to the baby and mother’s health and was undergone without any complications.

The 600-pound woman was brought in emergency by ambulance, her family unable to carry her in an automobile
The doctor who practiced the cesarean section first believed the woman to be pregnant with twins or even triplets.

“I have dealt with other women suffering from obesity before but this birth will stick with me until I die” he told reporters with a large grin. “I truly believed there was two or even three babies in there” he commented laughingly, “but no, it was just one big sturdy guy. He obviously has a career as a future rugby player” he added with humor.
The largest recorded baby in the world was previously thought to be a South African baby who is believed to have weighted 38 pounds (17.2 kilos) and was born in 1839. The young boy of Zulu origin is reported to have grown to an impressive 7’6 feet or 2.28 meters high before he reached his 18th birthday.","0"

Additionally, we were told there might be as many as four iOS 8.3 beta versions. Apple released iOS 8.3 beta 2 earlier this week, so that leaves two more versions before the company makes it publicly available to customers.

iOS 8.3 adds support for multiple new features and is filled with improvements in the operating system, though the biggest addition is support for the upcoming Apple Watch, which is slated to be released in early April.

"Amazon Is Opening a Brick-and-Mortar Store in Manhattan","Amazon, the cyber store that sells everything, plans to open its first physical store at 7 W 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan just in time for the holiday season. The experimental store will work as a mini-warehouse for some same day deliveries in New York. It'll surely serve as a nice little billboard, too.

The new brick-and-mortar shop is actually across the street from the Empire State Building, so it's clearly primo real estate. That's surely why analysts think that Amazon is opening the space as a marketing effort. It doesn't hurt that the company will be able to show off its (now sizable) lineup of products, including Kindles of all kinds and the new Fire phone. The store will also handle pick-ups and returns.

This is not the first time that Amazons's toyed with the idea of a physical presence, however. Rumors were rampant a couple of years ago that the company was going to open a similar-sounding store in Seattle. But hey, why open a store in a small city, when you can open a warehouse at the foot of the Empire State Building. [WSJ]

"Amazon is opening its first physical store","Digital retail company Amazon announced Thursday it plans to open its first brick-and-mortar store in midtown Manhattan in time for holiday shopping season.

The company's first physical location will function as more of a warehouse than a big-box store. The location will have a limited supply of items available for same-day delivery in the city, and will process returns, exchanges, and pickup orders, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Amazon did not immediately say how long the experimental store would remain open, nor whether it was preparing to open similar physical locations elsewhere in the country.

"Amazon.com to open first physical store in Manhattan: DJ","Amazon.com announced plans for its first brick-and-mortar store, Dow Jones reported. It will open on 34th Street in Manhattan across the street from the Empire State Building, just in time for this year's holiday season.

The experimental pop-up store will function as a small warehouse, holding limited inventory for same-day deliveries only in New York. The store may also host tech showcases for items such as Kindle e-readers, Fire phones and Fire TVs.

A customer may order an item online and then pick it up that same day in the store.

Amazon stock was down 2 percent in midafternoon trading Thursday.

The company risks increasing costs related to retailing such as paying leases and hiring workers. But if the store is successful, it may set a precedent for additional stores in other cities.

Amazon has been researching and scouting a possible store for several years, said a person familiar with the project. Two years ago, the company went as far as scouting spots in Seattle, where it is headquartered.

""Same-day delivery, ordering online and picking up in-store are ideas that are really catching on. Amazon needs to be at the center of that,"" Matt Nemer, a Wells Fargo analyst, told Dow Jones.

Other companies such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot have already incorporated this order-online, pick-up in-store model. Clothing company Bonobos opened 10 stores in 2011 and plans to expand to 40 stores by 2016.

Amazon tried brick-and-mortar experiments before, such as Kindle vending machines that sold tablets and e-readers in malls.","0"
"Amazon's first brick-and-mortar store said to open in Manhattan","It's hardly a secret that Amazon wants to be your go-to store for everything, but despite it's big pushes for same-day delivery there's still nothing like trudging into a physical store when you need something in a rush. Amazon seems to understand that all too well -- according to reports from CNBC and the Wall Street Journal, the e-commerce titan is gearing up to open its first brick-and-mortar store in midtown Manhattan in time for the holidays.

The move might seem a little out of character for a company like Amazon, but this isn't the first time it's thought about moving off of the internet and into meatspace. Two years ago, rumor had it that Amazon was going to open a physical shop in Seattle devoted to Amazon-exclusive books and its slew of Kindle gadgets. Oh, and who could forget those Amazon lockers you could choose to route your goodies to? Amazon's vision for its role in the real world has evolved a bit since then -- the Journal notes that the New York outpost could act as a way to highlight its own products like Fire TV, but the bigger draw is the space's role as a same-day product pickup location/customer service hub. Think about it: you'd be able to purchase something from Amazon and schlep down to the store on 34th Street to pick it up. Not exactly what you expected? You'd be able to return it to that very same spot. That sense of physical immediacy is something that Amazon has always lacked -- now we'll just have to wait and see if it's enough to warrant opening more of these things.

"Amazon to launch first brick-and-mortar store, report says","Amazon may be venturing beyond the world of online retail to set up its first brick-and-mortar shop, according to a report from Bloomberg News.

The store will be in Seattle and its focus will be pricier merchandise such as tablet computers, the report says. And its footprint won’t be nearly as large as that of big box retailers such as Barnes & Noble.

The single store is a test run for Amazon to see whether a chain of retail outlets could be profitable. If so, it could be a way for the company to make up for the declines they’ve seen in profits due to the manufacturing costs of the Kindle Fire.

The blog Good E Reader reports that Amazon has hired a designer to begin work on the store’s look and layout and that it is aiming to open its doors later this year in time for the holiday shopping season.

There would be certain advantages to Amazon having retail stores — namely that some items could be picked up immediately instead of going through shipping once they were purchased online.

Over at Forbes, Eric Savitz notes that this isn’t the first time that there have been rumors about Amazon opening a chain of stores — in 2009 similar rumors surfaced after the Sunday Times reported the online retailer was looking at properties. Amazon quickly refuted the report.

"Obama Orders Fed To Adopt Euro Currency","(WASHINGTON, DC) – In the boldest takeover of Presidential authority in history, Barack Obama ordered the Federal Reserve to adopt the euro beginning October 1, 2015, the start of the next fiscal year. The US will soon share the single monetary system used by 18 European Union member states, including Greece, France, Germany, and Slovakia.

The surprise announcement resulted from secret overseas deals between Obama, foreign finance ministers and the Federal Reserve System. “This step forward,” announced Obama, “will make it easier for Americans and Wall Street to compare prices, stabilize the economy, and set us up to again become leaders on the world economic stage.” The President revealed the changeover during the worldwide economic summit held in Beijing, where alongside Chinese premier Li Keqiang, he worked out a climate accord agreement, also developed in secrecy.

Criticism has been swift and severe. “Obama’s given up entirely on our US economy after single-handedly destroying it,” said Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX 8th District), Chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.

“It’s like breaking all the toys in the toybox and then saying I don’t want to play with those broken products anymore,” said former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. “This is the most abusive power grab witnessed on the worldwide stage. He needs to consider staying over in China while he’s there,” she added.

To help with the conversion to the euro, a new whitehouse.gov website will launch in early 2015, complete with downloadable conversion calculators and apps. Printable vouchers will be provided for discounts toward government manufactured cash registers. A children’s website featuring ‘Yuri the Happy Euro‘ will help prepare youngsters for the new system.

For the first 3 months of the conversion, euro notes and coins will circulate jointly with US currency, owing to overlap with the 2015 holiday season. “We don’t want to add any extra stress to an already hectic time of year,” said the President. “My economic team predicts everything will go smoothly, and holiday shopping should be stronger than ever.”

Many unanswered questions remain. Will vendors take advantage of the new system to gouge consumers? What about ATMs? Will small businesses who can’t afford to make the changeover right away close up shop and further weaken an increasingly unstable Obama economy?

“I think it’s a good idea, said Washington DC shop owner Vonda Miller. “I spend too much time counting pennies all day long making change. They tell me my taxes will be easier to do, so I’m for whatever the President wants.”

National Report will keep readers informed with updates about the anticipated massive fallout over this latest political bombshell, occurring during the last days of Obama’s increasingly emboldened administration.","0"
"Rumor: Apple to hold event this month to unveil Retina MacBook Air & finalize Apple Watch specs","Apple may be planning to hold a media event in late February to showcase the final version of its upcoming Apple Watch, and also debut a newly redesigned MacBook Air, potentially with a Retina display, according to a new report.

Word of a potential late-February event was reported on Wednesday by French Apple publication iGen, citing unnamed sources. Specifically, it was said that Tuesday, Feb. 24, could be a likely date for such an event to unveil upcoming products.

Rumors have suggested that Apple will launch an all-new 12-inch MacBook Air with a thinner chassis this quarter, which concludes at the end of March. A late February event could set Apple up to debut the new MacBook Air within that timeframe.

It's expected that the redesigned MacBook Air will sport a high-resolution 12-inch Retina display. There have also been claims that the device will feature the new, smaller, reversible USB 3.0 port.

As for the Apple Watch, although Apple offered a preview of the device and its appearance last September, the company has been working behind the scenes to finalize the hardware and software ahead of its launch in April. A February event could give Apple an opportunity to offer more specifics on the upcoming wearable device, such as battery life.

Another potential product unveiling could be a so-called ""iPad Pro,"" rumored to feature a 12.2-inch display. However, it's been reported that the device may not launch until the second quarter of 2015, making it potentially a candidate for WWDC.

Apple hasn't held a major event early in the year in a few years, instead waiting to unveil new products at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The last time Apple held a major product unveiling event in the first quarter of the calendar year was for the third-generation iPad in 2012.

iGen has a respectable track record in predicting Apple's future plans. Last fall, the site got its hands on Foxconn schematics that showed the final design of the iPhone 6, and the site also predicted the launch details for Apple's latest-generation handsets.","0"
"Apple’s next big event reportedly set for late February","Apple’s next media event might be less than three weeks away. French Apple fan site iGen has received information from its sources which indicates that Apple will take the stage during the last week of February, most likely on Tuesday, February 24th.

DON’T MISS: The stupidest thing you’ll read today: ‘The Apple Watch will flop’

Apple typically holds it events within a few weeks of launching a new product, but as we learned during the company’s recent earning call, the Apple Watch won’t start shipping until April. That said, it’s been quite some time since Apple held an event this early in the year, so it’s worth tempering any expectations for what the company has in store.

If the event does end up taking place in February, it’s likely that we’ll be seeing a lot more than just the wearable. The latest version of the MacBook Air might make an appearance as well — possibly the 12-inch model about which rumors have been circulating for months.

This isn’t definitive confirmation, but it would honestly be more surprising to see the company miss out on another huge opportunity to get consumers excited about a brand new product. If Apple does have an event planned for this month, the invitations should start arriving before too long. We’ll know for sure within a matter of days.

UPDATE: According to 9to5Mac’s sources, Apple currently has no plans to hold an event in February:

“While it’s highly likely that Apple will hold an advance event to officially launch the Apple Watch and begin preorders ahead of shipping, the actual date remains a question mark,” writes 9to5Mac’s Jordan Kahn.","0"

"Apple Media Event Rumored for Late February, Apple Watch and 12"" MacBook Air Likely Topics [Updated]","Apple may be planning to hold a special event during the month of February, according to French Apple-focused website iGen [Google Translate] (via iDownloadBlog). The site's sources, which are often reliable, suggest that the event might take place during the last week of February, potentially on Tuesday, February 24.

The event may see Apple once again showcasing the Apple Watch, which is set to debut in April, and it may also see the launch of the 12-inch MacBook Air. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently predicted that the upcoming notebook will debut in March, which is in line with a late-February unveiling.

Rendering of the 12-inch MacBook Air by Martin Hajek
Apple's 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to feature a new ultrathin design that does away with fans and introduces a revamped trackpad. It may include a low-power Core-M processor and it may be the first device to take advantage of the new reversible USB Type-C connector, which is much smaller and allows a USB cable to be inserted into a notebook in any orientation.

Apple may also use the event to unveil additional details on the Apple Watch, such as pricing and battery life. An event showing off the Apple Watch could explain why Apple has been asking some developers to have their apps ready to launch in the App Store in mid-February, as we reported last week. It's possible that Apple will use apps from these developers to demonstrate additional capabilities of the watch.

Though rumored, a February event is by no means confirmed at this point, and it is unclear what else Apple might cover in addition to the Apple Watch and the 12-inch MacBook Air.

Update 12:23 PM: Sources speaking to 9to5Mac have indicated Apple will not be holding a late February media event.

"Apple May Or May Not Hold An Event On The 24th Of February [Rumor]","The Apple Watch has been scheduled to begin shipping in April according to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook. Now presumably Apple might want to make some kind of announcement regarding the prices and the finalized specs of the device, and given that it is their first wearable, it doesn’t seem like a stretch.
That being said, a report from French Apple website iGen (via AppleInsider) claims to have heard from their sources that this event could be held on the 24th of February in which Apple is expected to share the finalized specs and launch plans for the Apple Watch, and will also be announcing the rumored 12-inch MacBook Air.
Previously we have heard rumors that the 12-inch MacBook Air could be launched in Q1 2015 so an announcement either in February or by the end of March would coincide with the rumors. However we should also note that the folks at 9to5Mac have heard from their own sources that the 24th of February event will not be happening.
9to5Mac does not dispute the possibility of Apple holding a special event to launch their new products, but rather the actual date which their sources have told them will not be the 24th of February. Given that both websites have been pretty reliable when it comes to Apple rumors, it’s hard to say who’s right. Either way we will be keeping our eyes and ears peeled for a possible invite, but in the meantime try not to get your hopes up just yet.

"Report claims steel Apple Watch to start at $500, gold model between $4-5K","French website iGen.fr, which has provided reliable information in the past, reported on Tuesday that the steel Apple Watch will start at $500 alongside a gold model that will retail for between $4,000 and $5,000. Apple previously claimed at its September event that the Apple Watch would start at $349, but did not disclose further pricing information.

The report claims that the stainless steel Apple Watch in polished steel or black will cost $500, while the gold Apple Watch Edition will be the more expensive version at between $4,000 and $5,000. That price range would be nearly half the estimated $10,000 price that some other reports have suggested.



 
In terms of a launch date, the report claims that the Apple Watch will launch in time for Valentine’s Day, but that was the most specific date given. We previously shared an internal memo from Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts in which she wrote that the Apple Watch will launch in the “Spring” following the Chinese New Year.

iGen.fr accurately reported that Apple would launch both the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 at its September event and has also provided information that proved true regarding an iPod touch update in the past.

Apple announced last month that its WatchKit SDK will be available in November.","0"
"Rumor: Gold Apple Watch Edition priced up to $5,000, steel version at $500, will debut on Feb. 14","A rumor on Tuesday claims Apple's upcoming Apple Watch will be priced at $500 for the mid-tier steel model and up to $5,000 for top-end gold ""Edition"" versions, a number much higher than previous estimates.

Citing an unnamed source, French website iGen reports Apple is looking to field the Apple Watch at a proposed retail cost of $500 for versions with stainless steel cases and between $4,000 and $5,000 for Apple Watch Edition models. This leaves the Apple Watch Sport version as Apple's lowest-priced option, which the company said would come in at $350.

While the website has been accurate in predicting recent Apple product launches, the claims are unverifiable and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Previous estimates from jewelers and industry analysts pegged high-end Apple Watch Edition models at $1,200. Edition versions are crafted from 18-karat gold, feature sapphire crystal and come with a variety of luxurious strap options. Apple has not commented on whether the entire chassis is solid gold, or merely gold plated, but the company apparently developed a variant of the metal twice as strong as the standard.

Additionally, the source claims Apple is still shooting for a launch on Valentine's Day.

Prior to the Apple Watch announcement, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo accurately predicted that the device would come in two sizes and multiple models spread across a wide range of price points. At the time, he speculated the wearable could cost into the ""thousands of dollars.""

Apple announced its anticipated first foray into the wearables market in September, saying only that pricing would start at $350. Given that the Apple Watch Sport is made from relatively low-cost materials — aluminum, elastomer band and non-sapphire window — many believe it to be the entry-level model.","0"
"Rumor: Stainless Steel Apple Watch Will Cost $500, Gold $4,000","While Apple announced that the base model of its forthcoming smartwatch would cost $350, it's remained tight-lipped about the pricing of the rest of the range. Now, a new report suggests that the stainless steel version will start at $500, and the gold at somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000.

The report comes from sources at Apple via French website iGen.fr. As MacRumors points out, the site has been reliable in the past, accurately reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

It's thought that the $350 price applies to the aluminum model of the watch. Certainly, $500 for the stainless steel version feels about right by comparison. The cost of the gold model, though; well, quite simply it depends on how much gold there is. We'll have to wait to find out, but such high pricing would indeed make it very much a luxury item.

The iGen.fr sources also claim that Apple is hoping to release the watch as soon as possible—though other rumors claim we may have to wait until Spring of 2015. Either way, we have longer to wait before we find out more than we'd like. [iGen.fr via MacRumors]","0"
"Report: Apple Watch to start at $500 in stainless steel, thousands for gold model","When Apple introduced its Apple Watch in September, the company said there would be three editions along with various face options and bands. Customers will literally have dozens of watch configurations to choose from. Only the base model got an official price of $349, however. Now a report claims to have pricing information on other editions.

MacRumors spotted a French blog whose sources suggest the stainless steel Apple Watch variant will start at $500 while gold models could cost $4,000 and up. The iGen blog has been credible in the past, correctly predicting the size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

If you take the view that Apple Watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget, the prices may not make that much sense. Look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts, though, and the anticipated costs sound viable. Apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist. It’s already considered a luxury brand by many and people are clearly willing to pay premium prices for that brand.

The stainless steel pricing is certainly believable to me. Look at Pebble to see why.

Pebble Steel fashion

 


You can buy a plastic Pebble smartwatch for as little as $99 now, recently discounted from its $149 price. The same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you $199, or double the plastic model’s price. It’s reasonable to assume an Apple Watch with stainless steel casing will cost $500 based on that. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap, with an additional $50 to $100 cost for a matching stainless steel strap.

Unfortunately, we’re not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring, as Apple won’t be selling the Apple Watch until then. For now, potential customers have time to save up for Apple’s timepiece — something they may need to do if they want an Apple Watch in gold.","0"
"Apple Watch Stainless Steel variant reportedly priced at $500, $4,000 for the gold variant","Along with unveiling the Apple Watch earlier this year, the company also announced that the prices for the wearable device will start at $349. French website iGen.fr now claims to have an idea about the pricing of the stainless steel variant, as well as the gold variant.

According to the publication, the stainless steel variant of the Apple Watch will be priced around $500, while the gold variant will be priced between $4,000 to $5,000. This is in line with earlier rumors, which claimed that the top-end variant of the Apple Watch will be priced above $1,000. While Apple didn’t announce which variant would be priced $350, it is widely believed to be the entry-level aluminum variant of the Apple Watch.

As for the availability, the publication claims that the first Apple Watch will start shipping by Valentine’s Day 2015. While this is in line with earlier rumors, it is in contrast with what Apple Retail SVP Angela Ahrendts hinted yesterday. In a video message to the company’s retail employees, she hinted that the Apple Watch will launch in spring next year. She said, “We’re going into the holidays, we’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring.”","0"
"Stainless steel Apple Watch could cost just $499, but gold will be 10 times as pricey","Although Apple has given us our first peek at the Apple Watch, so far we don’t know much about it, including when it will be released or how much its many versions will cost.

A new report, however, provides some possible answers to these questions. According to a French website, the Apple Watch will start at around $500 for the steel model. And gold? Gold will be even more expensive.

According to iGen.fr, the stainless steel Apple Watch in polished steel or black will cost $500 when it debuts close to Valentine’s Day of 2015. This would be a $150 premium over the anodized aluminum Sports Model, which Apple said last month would start at a price of $349.

For the gold model, expect to spend 10 times as much. According to iGen.fr’s sources, the gold Apple Watch in yellow or pink gold would cost between $4,000 and $5,000 when it goes on sale in January.

iGen.fr also suggests that the Apple Watch will rank low on the iFixIt repairability scale. They claim the only thing on the Apple Watch that will be user-replaceable is the strap, so don’t expect to be able to repair an Apple Watch the way you would a normal timepiece.

As for shipping date, iGen.fr’s sources say the Apple Watch is still on track for a February 2015 release date. That pink gold Apple Watch is looking like a pretty good Valentine’s Day present right now, isn’t it?","0"
"Info iGen: $ 500 for Apple Watch, February 14?","Despite a presentation in due form in September and a few public appearances (at Colette in Paris, in particular), Apple Watch is still shrouded in mystery: what are the prices of the different versions?

After cooking one of our contacts among the most reliable - who obviously wishes to remain anonymous - we can lift a corner of the veil on the prices of stainless steel versions and the gold (Edition ).

"Apple Watch Pricing to Reportedly Start at $500 for Stainless Steel, $4,000 for Gold","French Apple website iGen.fr is reporting [Google Translate] that pricing for the stainless steel Apple Watch may start at $500, while the gold Apple Watches' pricing could start between $4,000 and $5,000. iGen.fr has been reliable in the past, most recently reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

While Apple had announced that the Apple Watch would start at $350, which was widely assumed to be the price of the aluminum model, and estimates pegged the price of the gold Apple Watch at prices as low as $1,000 or as high as $5,000, there has been little information regarding the pricing of the stainless steel option.

The site's sources also indicate that Apple still aims to release the Apple Watch by Valentine's Day 2015, which somewhat echoes an earlier report that said the company would be ""lucky"" to release the device by that timeframe. iGen.fr also mentions that manufacturers and resellers are preparing as if the Watch would release in mid-February 2015. Previously, Apple Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts said the Watch would release in Spring 2015.","0"

Apple, of course, has been rather quiet on Apple Watch pricing, aside from indicating that lower-tier pricing will begin at $349 for the Apple Watch Sport models. That being the case, a $150 bump for stainless steel models isn't outside the realm of reason.

Interestingly, iGen.Fr also relays that Apple may still be trying to push for a release before Valentine's Day. This however is at odds with a previous report claiming that Apple is planning to release its highly anticipated wearable device this spring.

As with any anonymous rumor, the aforementioned pricing matrix should be taken with a grain of salt, especially because pricing is one of the few details prone to changing at any time. Still, because iGen.Fr has a rather solid track record with respect to Apple rumors, we felt it was worth passing this particular tidbit along.

On a related note, Tim Cook just last week confirmed that the Apple Watch will most likely have to be charged nightly.

Lastly, make sure to check out the many different looks of the Apple Watch over here. The stainless steel options look really great, and if the $500 price point is accurate, it may very well prove to be the most popular model.","0"
"Piper Jaffray pegs stainless steel Apple Watch price at $499, Edition at $4,999","Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices, saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349, analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands.

Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers — Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition — each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices.

Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options.

The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.

On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.

Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.

""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.

He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band — assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 — the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.

The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.

Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event, as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.

"High-end Apple Watch to start at $5,000 -- analyst","Would you pay five grand for the high-end luxury edition of the Apple Watch? That's the starting price that Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster sees in his crystal ball.

On March 9, Apple is expected to finally unveil the finer details of its Apple Watch, including the price tags and launch date. The company's first smartwatch will be available in three versions: Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition. Apple has already revealed that the entry-level Sport model will start at $349 in the US. But the company has been mum about the prices of the other two models.

In an investors note released late Monday, Munster said he expects that the price for the Sport model could reach as high as $450 depending on different case and storage options. The mid-tier Apple Watch could start at anywhere from $499 to $549 and likely will come closer to an average selling price of $650, according to Munster. But the top-of-the-line Apple Watch Edition could break the bank, starting at $4,999 and potentially reaching closer to $7,500 by factoring in high-end, expensive bands.

That $4,999 price lines up with a projection from Apple observer John Gruber, who forecast the cost of the high-end version last September.

Apple is a latecomer to a smartwatch market already crowded with entries from Samsung, LG, Motorola, Microsoft, Sony, Pebble and other players. Apple's product will be part smartwatch and part fitness and activity tracker, a combination the company is counting on to bring in buyers. But by offering the watch in a luxury edition, Apple is also presenting it as a piece of fine jewelry to further distinguish it from rival products.

Munster remains bearish on Apple Watch sales, estimating 8 million in unit sales this year, compared with Wall Street forecasts of 14 million. But the analyst believes next Monday's event ""will finally highlight the special features of the watch and start to excite the public.""

Apple will offer interchangeable bands for each of its watches, a factor that will determine the ultimate price. Munster said he believes the elastomer bands for the Apple Watch Sport will range in price from $29 to $39. Leather bands could be priced from $49 to $59. Steel bands could run around $99. And the gold bands for the higher-end edition may run into the thousands of dollars.

How might the three different versions of the watch play out in terms of sales? Munster said he expects the entry-level Sport edition to account for around 55 percent of all units sold this year, while the Apple Watch will contribute around 45 percent. That leaves the luxury Apple Watch Edition contributing pretty much nothing, at least in terms of percentage.

""The Apple Watch Edition is the more difficult to predict, but we believe that with the watch likely starting at $4,999, Apple might sell around 10,000 units in CY15 [calendar year 2015] of our total 8 million estimate, Munster said. ""To put the 10k units in perspective, Piper analyst Erinn Murphy, in conjunction with industry estimates, believes that Rolex sells 600-750K watches per year, thus Apple at 10K in the first year would be about 2 percent the size of Rolex. We believe this is a reasonable potential first year size as high-end consumers weigh the power of the Apple brand vs. other luxury watches and the trade-off of quickly depreciating technology in an Apple Watch vs. other more traditional luxury watches that may hold value better.""

A spokeswoman for Apple said the company had no comment at this time.","0"
"Gene Munster Predicts $499 Steel Apple Watch, $4,999 for 18k Gold Edition","Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster has issued a new report to investors, breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices.

He also said that on average, consumers will spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Apple watch versions

Apple Watch will be released in three separate price tiers i.e. Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, with each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices. Starting with Apple Watch Sport, Munster expects an ASP (average selling price) of $450 including configuration choices like case and internal storage options. The stainless steel Apple Watch model is expected to start at $499 to $549, with an overall ASP at around $650. Regarding the Apple Watch Edition, the analyst forecasts the base model to start at $4,999, while classifying segment ASP at $7,500.

Based on current pricing for Apple’s silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars. 

“If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,” Munster writes. 

Lastly, Munster expects the Sport model to make up 55% of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take 45%. As for Apple Watch Edition, Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year.

"Chinese rumor suggests Apple Watch to launch in February, sapphire to blame for low supply","Chinese site Feng is reporting that Taiwanese media is saying that Apple wants to launch the smartwatch sometime in February. Most recently, The Information said Apple would be “lucky” to release the Apple Watch by Valentine’s Day. Officially, Apple has only quoted ‘early 2015′ as a launch window for the Apple Watch.

According to the report, Apple is supply constrained by the sapphire output of GTAT, which will mean the Apple Watch will hit in limited quantities. However, it is important to note that the low-end Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Sport, does not use sapphire at all, which will make that model easier to source. The higher end versions, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition are the SKU’s that will be impacted by sapphire shortages.



 
Most notably, right now the limiting factor on Apple Watch isn’t really component availability. First things first, Apple needs to finish the development of the Apple Watch software and hardware internally.

To date, all of the Apple Watch’s handled by press have been non-functional, showing only non-interactive videos of the user interface. This means that Apple still has a long way to go before the device is in any kind of shippable state. It has been previously rumored that Apple is working hard to improve battery longevity, for example.

Moreover, although Apple has announced WatchKit, which will enable third-party developers to create interactive notifications for the Watch, no SDK has been released to actually allow development. Apple Watch integration may come as part of iOS 8.2 for example, which is currently in development.","0"
"New rumor backs up reports that the Apple Watch will launch in February","The much-anticipated Apple Watch — which was recently unveiled to Apple fans everywhere — may just be getting a February launch date according to a rumor that originated on a Taiwanese news site.

This rumor would clearly fit right into the “early 2015″ release timeframe stated by Apple executives during the device’s unveiling. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Senior VP of Operations Jeff Williams explained the situation to Bloomberg BusinessWeek.

“We want to make the best product in the world,” Williams said, with Cook adding, “One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them. We could have done the watch much earlier, honestly, but not at the fit and finish and quality and integration of these products. And so we are willing to wait.”

anigif_enhanced-2741-1410388337-5

When the watch is finally released, it may be in short supply due to constraints attributed to the sapphire output at Apple’s supplier GTAT, not to mention the company is still working on perfecting the design, software and manufacturing of the watches themselves.

The Apple Watch Sport seems like it will not be affected by the rumored limited release like the Apple Watch Edition version will. Unlike the pricier models, the Apple Watch Sport doesn’t use Sapphire at all.

We’ll have to see if this rumor turns out to be true, but for the time being all we know for sure is that the watch will be released in “early 2015.”","0"
"New Rumour Suggests Apple Watch to Launch in February","Rumors have been circulating that the Apple Watch will launch in February.","0"
"Are Rumors of the Apple Watch in Feb True?","When Tim Cook finally announced the long-awaited Apple Watch on September 9, the company promised an “early 2015” release. Since then, it’s really been anybody’s guess as to when, exactly, that might end up being. A few new rumors, however, suggest that we’ll get the Apple Watch sometime in February…but it’s likely that it’ll be later than that.

Today, a post on 9to5Mac points the way back to a report from Chinese site Feng, which itself cites “Taiwanese media” as saying that the Apple Watch is likely to hit sometime in February, though not without a fair bit of challenges to overcome. The reports say that the supply of sapphire crystal – which will compose the displays of the highest-end Apple Watch units – has led to some difficulties in manufacturing.

However, it should be noted that if sapphire is the biggest problem facing the Apple Watch, then Apple’s in good shape. The software itself is still in development, and as the 9to5Mac post points out, the company has yet to release the WatchKit SDK for developers to start making all the cool apps that’ll run on the device.

Another report from Asia this week claims that production on the Apple Watch isn’t set to start at manufacturing partner Quanta until sometime in January – and with only a month of actual production, it seems doubtful that Apple would truly be ready to sell the Watch by February. And last week, an unnamed Apple insider was quoted as saying that the company would be “lucky to ship it by Valentine’s Day.” If that quote is true, then February seems like a tall order.

That said, March doesn’t seem too out of the question. Nor does April. In fact, considering that Motorola promised the Moto 360 smartwatch by “summer 2014,” and didn’t launch it until early September, it would seem that OEMs are pretty loose about their definitions for launch windows. “Early 2015” is simply anything before the very last day in June. And barring any major disasters, we should start to see Apple Watches on consumers’ wrists long before then.

The main question, though, is what cool stuff will the competition cook up between then and now…","0"
"Apple Watch launch has new timetable: Analyst","After multiple delays, the launch of the Apple Watch will be put off until early next year, Rosenblatt Securities Senior Research Analyst Brian Blair said Friday.

""There's really no right time of the year for this product to come out because really hasn't existed yet,"" said Blair. ""It is kind of a strange period, but the more production gets pushed back, the later it's going to launch. It looks like right now February is the best shot they have.""

On CNBC's ""Fast Money,"" Blair said that the majority of the issues Apple is addressing with the delay are internal, one of which is battery life.

""The word is that the battery lasts for about a day,"" he said. ""That's going to be a problem for a lot of consumers.

""If they can talk about two days, three days, where you don't have to charge it every single night when you go to bed, that will ultimately bring more consumers to the product.""","0"
"Apple Watch launch reportedly planned for February with limited supply","The Apple Watch is on track for a February release, according to supply chain sources in China. A February launch echoes an earlier report from The Information, which said Apple will be “lucky” to ship by Valentine’s Day.

While mass manufacturing of the Apple Watch hasn’t begun yet, there are already concerns that sapphire production won’t be able to meet initial demand. The constraints will likely result in making more expensive Apple Watch models harder to come by.

All sapphire for the Apple Watch is coming from Apple’s plant with GT Advanced (GTAT) in Arizona. Because of Apple’s very stringent quality specifications, GTAT will reportedly be unable to meet the level of output Apple had hoped.

Not all Apple Watch models use a sapphire display, however. The lowest-end Apple Watch Sport uses strengthened Ion-X glass, while the mid-level Apple Watch and higher-end gold Apple Watch Edition use sapphire.

Initial supply constraints are not uncommon for Apple products, especially entirely new product categories like the Watch. If lines to see the Watch in person during Paris Fashion Week are any indication, demand will be extremely high when it goes on sale.

Since the Apple Watch was unveiled last month, it’s been clear that the product is unfinished on multiple levels. Demo units shown to the press have been running videos on continuous loops, and Apple hasn’t said anything about pricing. All Apple has said about availability is that it plans to ship by “early 2015.”

"Apple Watch mass production kicks off in January: Report","According to a news source from Taiwan, the mass production stage of the Apple Watch will not begin until January.
In addition to the delay in start of mass production, the G for Games blog also reported that the Apple Watch will instead be assembled by only one supplier, as opposed to the two suppliers that was previously rumored.
The information about the January start of mass production was revealed [in Chinese] by AppleDaily, which adds that the reported time frame of the start of mass production will make questionable Apple's statements that the Apple Watch will become available to the public by early 2015.
The Apple Watch was unveiled by Apple on Sept. 9, in the same event where the company unveiled the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The device is Apple's first entry into the wearable technology market, wherein rivals such as Samsung and LG and startup companies such as Pebble have already established their presence.
In the event, Apple said that the Apple Watch will begin to be sold to the public in early 2015 without specifying a definite time frame. However, if Apple really does intend to release the device early next year, mass production should already have started.
AppleDaily's report of a January start date for the Apple Watch's mass production could mean that the delay was due to the suppliers that Apple tapped for the device.
Earlier rumors suggested that two suppliers will be assembling the Apple Watch, namely Quanta Computer and Inventec. However, AppleDaily's report specifies that Quanta will be the only supplier to Apple for the device, with Inventec being removed from the process due to reasons that have not been made clear.
Quanta has started its preparations for the mass production of the Apple Watch, increasing its workforce to a total of 4 million employees, reported G for Games. There is also said to be an agreement between Apple and Quanta that the Chinese supplier will not be manufacturing smartwatches for Apple's rival companies in the industry.
The delayed mass production start, coupled with the sudden departure of a supplier, will make it difficult for Apple to keep its promise of an early-2015 release for the Apple Watch.
The delay will only add to the conservative expectations that Piper Jaffray investment firm analyst Gene Munster has on the sales forecasts for the Apple Watch.
""Overall, we believe that the Apple Watch is light years ahead of any other smartwatch on the market, but consumer application may be limited initially until developers begin to create useful applications for the watch,"" Munster wrote.

"Apple: Citi Sees $550 and $950 Apple Watches, Accessory Plethora","Jim Suva with Citigroup this evening weighs in with what to expect from the March 9th media event in San Francisco that Apple (AAPL) announced today, an event that is likely focused on Apple Watch, given that, as he points out, Daylight Savings Time starts the day before, March 8th, so the tag line of the event, “Spring Forward,” is an apt time reference.

Suva, who has a Buy rating on Apple, and a $135 price target, lays out the prospects for details about the watch, including pricing:

We expect Apple to give specifics on the launch time, price, and geographic locations, which we estimate as: Launch date: April 16th; Price points: $350, $550 and $950; with a launch limited to the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia in the subsequent months. A flurry of fashionable accessories including various colors and materials (plastic, leather, and metal, including high-end metals such as gold, silver and platinum), starting at $29 and ranging over several hundred dollars. We expect features to include Apple Pay, adjustable notifications due to personal frequency and preferences, Apple Health, variable haptic feedback, and battery life of one day (under normal use). Purchase locations to be Apple retail stores and Apple online store only. Hundreds of applications immediately available upon release, ranging from social, financial, health, sports and news etc.

Apple is more likely to benefit from continued iPhone 6 sales, Suva opines. Still, the WTch is among things that expand its addressable market:

We do note Apple is actively expanding its total available market (watches, payments, automotive etc). We expect Apple to sell 3.1M watch units in the June qtr, with a F12M est of 17.1M watch units.

"Analyst: Apple Watch Edition to Cost $950","Citigroup analyst Jim Suva weighed in with his expectations for Apple Watch pricing following the news that Apple is hosting a media event on March 9. Apple already announced pricing will start at US$349—presumably for the Apple Watch Sport—and he thinks Apple Watch will cost $550 while the Apple Watch Edition will be priced at $950. He's also pegging April 16 as the smartwatch's official release date.

Citigroup analyst thinks Apple Watch Edition will cost $950, not $5,000Citigroup analyst thinks Apple Watch Edition will cost $950, not $5,000

On Apple's March 9 media event he said,

We expect Apple to give specifics on the launch time, price, and geographic locations, which we estimate as: Launch date: April 16th; Price points: $350, $550 and $950; with a launch limited to the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia in the subsequent months.
Setting Apple Watch Sport at $350 and the standard Apple Watch at $550 falls in line with the general consensus, but the $950 price point he's targeting for Apple Watch Edition comes in well below expectations. Apple Watch Edition ships with a gold body instead of aluminium or stainless steel, and is generally expected to start somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000.

Mr. Suva said he expects Apple will offer a wide variety of accessories for Apple watch with bands starting at $29 and topping out in the hundreds of dollars. He also thinks hundreds of apps will be available on launch day.

He offered up his thoughts on which features we'll see in Apple Watch when it launches saying, ""We expect features to include Apple Pay, adjustable notifications due to personal frequency and preferences, Apple Health, variable haptic feedback, and battery life of one day (under normal use).""

Shoppers hoping to be the first to get an Apple Watch will be able to buy theirs in Apple's own retail stores and through the company's online store. Mr. Suva expects Apple's smartwatch won't be available through other retailers.

Apple sent out media invitations on Thursday for a March 9 event teased as ""Spring forward,"" which is a play on the Day Light Saving change happening on March 8, and likely a thinly veiled hint that we'll be getting more Apple Watch news.

When Apple first showed off its smartwatch last September, we saw three models with a wide selection of bands, support for tracking basic fitness activity such as steps and distance walked, along with heart rate logging. Apple Watch will also offer Apple Pay support, and will require an iPhone to perform many of its tasks.

Mr. Suva has a ""Buy"" rating on Apple's stock along with a $135 target price. Apple is currently trading at $129.59, down 0.82 (0.63%).

[Thanks to Barrons for the heads up]

The Mac Observer Spin 
Mr. Suva's $950 price point for the gold Apple Watch Edition is surprisingly low compared to the general consensus that it won't start below $5,000 and could cost more than $10,000. We'll have to wait until Apple's March 9 media event where Apple Watch pricing is expected to be announced to see how close he really is.","0"
"Will Apple hit a Valentine’s Day 2015 target for the Apple Watch’s release?","You may remember Apple CEO Tim Cook teasing major new product categories for Apple to be released in 2014. Technically, that will happen with Apple Pay next month, Apple’s first foray into the mobile payments category, but it is far more likely that Cook had been focusing his teases on the Apple Watch. Earlier this month, Apple debuted the fashion and fitness-oriented smart watch to the same crowd that saw the debut of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. While the Watch was demonstrated, it is obviously not a finished product: it’s not shipping until “early 2015,” according to Apple.

How early in 2015? Nobody knows for sure, but a new profile from The Information says “that Apple would be lucky to ship it by Valentine’s Day.” At 9to5, we’ve been hearing similar whispers. Valentine’s Day is in February, and this could be a great target for Apple to try to hit for the Watch’s launch. That Hallmark Holiday isn’t as strong as a shopping season as the December holidays, but it is still a time that many people seek out expensive or fashionable gifts. So why not the Apple Watch Edition, too? Apple has done product launches around that timeframe before, releasing new iOS device storage capacities and pink-colored models on multiple occasions.

Valentine’s Day aside, the bigger picture here is that many signs indicate Apple missed its own 2014 launch target. As The Information says:



 
Earlier this year, Apple executives indicated to some employees and others involved in the product that it was expected launch for the holidays. After all, since 2011, Apple has configured itself for once-a-year launches of new versions of its flagship hardware, the iPhone, in time for the Western world’s peak shopping season. But at some point in recent months that changed, according to these people, who surmised that Apple wanted more time on the software and the apps. The Information previously reported some development hiccups, including consideration of a new screen. The inside chatter parallels a shift among analysts as well; in the months before the announcement, many shifted their forecasts from this year to next.

Seemingly confirming this is commentary from Cook and Apple Senior VP of Operations Jeff Williams (who supervised the Apple Watch software and hardware engineering groups) in an interview with Bloomberg BusinessWeek. Asked why the Apple Watch missed a 2014 target, the executives responded:

Williams is unapologetic about the Apple Watch missing the 2014 holiday season. “We want to make the best product in the world,” he says. “One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them.” Cook also preaches patience. “We could have done the watch much earlier, honestly, but not at the fit and finish and quality and integration of these products,” he says. “And so we are willing to wait.”

So it seems fairly clear that 2014 was the original, missed target, but Apple is unapologetic about the entire situation. After all, this makes sense. Apple has been teasing a new category for years during the post-Steve Jobs-era, and they need to get it mostly right on version 1.0. Cook has even hinted that his own Apple Watch has yet-to-be-introduced functionality, and we don’t even know the pricing or exact details about the device (beyond the Sport model), so perhaps Apple will announce everything else related to the Watch on their website or at an event early next year.","0"
"Apple Watch Likely Be Launched On Valentine’s Day; Plus First Apple Watch Accessory To Be Showcased In CES 2015","At CES 2015 event scheduled between Jan. 6 and Jan. 9, a potential company named Standzout will be showcasing its prototype of the Apple Watch accessory. The accessory in focus is the ""Bandstand Apple Watch dock."" The aforesaid company calls it the first great Apple Watch accessory ever.

The dock apparently makes use of an ""induction charging plate to power the gadget"" and by doing so, it holds the smartwatch in place. In addition, there are two USB ports housed on the device to enable the user to charge other devices like Apple iPhones and iPads, notes Phone Arena. Interested readers can check out the Bandstand Apple Watch dock prototype from Gigaom.

When it comes to Apple Watch release date, reports state that the Cupertino-headquartered company might launch its gadget on Valentine's Day. Meanwhile, the sales predictions for the Apple Watch are as high as 30 million units and the demand is assumed to grow further, according to the same site. In contrast to other smartwatches available in the market, Apple will reportedly be marketing the Watch as a fashion accessory than a tech gear.

When it comes to key features of the Apple Watch, the company is believed to be working on two different models, namely 38 mm and 42 mm versions of the smartwatch. Moreover, the gadget with high focus on fashion will be offered in six different casing options. In addition, the smartwatch's band can reportedly be interchanged as required. As far as the pricing details go, the base variant of the Apple Watch i.e. the sports model will reportedly be priced at $349. But then, the high-end variants especially the solid gold/diamond model will go as high as several thousand dollars, says MacRumors.

Moving on to the higher-end Apple Watch, Apple is planning to release a $30,150 priced model of the smartwatch, adorned in diamonds and sapphire. The sapphire and diamond-clad gadget will reportedly come with eight rows of ""high-grade 15 carat diamonds"" and it is considered to be the ""luxury edition"" of the smartwatch. Apparently, this device will also come equipped with sapphire glass display for extra protection, notes Phone Arena.","0"
"Your Apple Watch might be ready just in time for Valentine’s Day","The Apple Watch was Apple’s “one more thing” announcement during its iPhone 6 event, but the company still left many questions about the device unanswered. One of them is the device’s actual release date, as Apple simply said during the keynote that the device is coming in early 2015. Meanwhile, The Information has learned from sources familiar with the matter that Apple employees and partners were expecting “until recently” to see the Watch in stores this year.

“Earlier this year, Apple executives indicated to some employees and others involved in the product that it was expected launch for the holidays,” the publication writes. “But at some point in recent months that changed, according to these people, who surmised that Apple wanted more time on the software and the apps. The Information previously reported some development hiccups, including consideration of a new screen.”

Apparently, “Apple would be lucky to ship it by Valentine’s Day” next year, although an actual launch date for the device is still not available.

For what it’s worth, 9to5Mac says it heard similar whispers about a tentative Valentine’s Day launch for the smartwatch.

In a recent interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Apple senior vice president of operations Jeff Williams basically confirmed that Apple needs more time refining the device before it’s ready to sell it to customers, taking a hit at Samsung in the process. “We want to make the best product in the world,” he said. “One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them.”

"Rumor: Apple Watch Production Gearing Up For Valentine's Day Release With High Prices","Production is ""gearing up"" for the upcoming launch of the Apple Watch, according to a fresh report from Digitimes.

Industry sources indicate that as many as 40 million units of Apple's custom chip have been ordered to prepare for initial shipments. These numbers suggest that the Cupertino tech giant is expecting high global demand for its innovative smartwatch.


Along with those high production stats, however, come potentially high prices for consumers. When the Apple Watch was first revealed in September, the base model was announced at a $350 for an aluminum band. This is well over $100 more than similar products from competitors like Sony and Motorola. The ever-looming Apple tax doesn't stop there either.

Apple Watch stainless steel bands could start as high as $500, says French Apple blog iGen.fr, while wealthy buyers hoping to purchase a solid gold band for their Apple smartwatch may have to shell out as much as $5,000. French pricing schemes may vary widely from what we see on day one in the United States, so the accuracy of these figures is still up for debate. Fans of Apple products are used to paying higher prices for premium goods, and that trend seems to be alive and well in the company's latest product.

For those wondering when the Apple Watch hits store shelves, a recent rumor report from Business Insider pegs a release as soon as Valentine's Day 2015. That date is supposedly an optimistic one, however, so officials at Apple are more inclined to stick to a tentative spring 2015 time frame.

As production enters its heaviest phases, Apple seems ready to tackle the watch industry in full force. What remains to be seen, is if the company's first massive chip order will be enough to satisfy consumer demand.

"Valentine’s Day 2015 May Be The Apple Watch Release Target","Almost throughout the entire year we constantly heard rumors that Apple’s smartwatch will be released later this year. A couple of weeks back the Apple Watch was formally unveiled but the company also revealed that it won’t hit the market until early 2015. There has already been much speculation about why Apple missed its 2014 launch target for this wearable device but what most people are now interested is when it’ll finally be available? If recent reports are to be believed then Valentine’s Day 2015 may be the Apple Watch release target.
Every year Apple releases its new iPhones and iPads around the holiday season which is one of the most lucrative shopping seasons of the year. Probably why it was assumed from the very start that Apple’s smartwatch too would be released around the same time.
But recently rumors about production issues starting cropping up, hinting that the release may have been pushed back as a result of these delays. While Apple hasn’t confirmed if production issues really did play a part in pushing the smartwatch’s release into 2015 CEO Tim Cook did remark in an interview with Bloomberg BusinessWeek that Apple “could have done the watch much earlier, honestly, but not at the fit and finish and quality and integration of these products.”
Valentine’s Day doesn’t see shopping frenzy that can rival the lucrative holiday season but its still that time of the year when people are a bit loose with their wallets. The Information reports on the possibility of Apple shipping the smartwatch by Valentine’s Day 2015 and 9to5mac has been hearing whispers about the same, still there no confirmation on this from Cupertino.
Whenever the Apple Watch ultimately go on sale it will start from $349.","0"
"The Apple Watch Will Debut by Late March [Report]","While hype around the Apple Watch has remained steady, one factor has hurt consumers' interest: No one has known when it's arriving. All that Apple revealed was that the device — its first foray into wearables — would be unveiled sometime in early 2015. Does that mean right after New Year's? Or early Spring? Now, we're getting a clearer idea on the release date for the Apple Watch.

Sources familiar with the product’s development told 9to5Mac that the device is on track to ship by the end of March. Additionally, multiple sources revealed that Apple is planning a comprehensive testing program to train retail store employees on the new product between Feb. 9-16.

The program will entail sending one to two associates from each U.S. store to the company's offices in Cupertino, California or Austin, Texas. There, employees will be familiarized with all the features of the watch first-hand. Those employees will then train the staff at their respective stores.

While the plan is reportedly to release the wearable in March, 9to5Mac noted that unexpected delays are always a possibility. If there are any setbacks in terms of software development or manufacturing, the Apple Watch may not hit stores until April or later.

As I wrote in December:

Apple certainly made some smart decisions for the firm’s foray into wearables. For one, the company refused to describe the product as a “smartwatch” — something that separated their gadget from competitors’. On the other hand, the tech giant also opted not to hold any big press events about the watch after their initial announcement, and marketing efforts have been relatively weak in comparison to their other products.
While Apple analyst Gene Munster has pointed to waning interest in the Apple Watch, analysts such as Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research has still been arguing that the Apple Watch will be a smash success, Barron’s reported. (Chowdhry even argued that every iPhone user will also be an Apple Watch user, according to Barron's.)","0"
"Report: Apple Watch to Ship in March","Rumors about a spring launch for the Apple Watch might be true; the latest reports tip a March arrival.
Cupertino is reportedly planning to hold ""extensive testing programs"" between Feb. 9 and 16 to acquaint Apple Store employees with the new product category. Citing anonymous sources, 9to5Mac suggested that store representatives will be sent to Apple offices in Cupertino or Austin for hands-on experience, which they will then pass on to in-store employees.
Apple unveiled its long-awaited smartwatch in early September, showing off the device, which comes in three variants with different bands: Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport, and Apple Watch Edition.

"KGI: iPhone sales forecast at 73M for Q4 ahead of Apple Watch debut in March, 12"" MacBook Air in Q1","Apple is forecast to have shipped a whopping 73 million iPhones over the 2014 holiday quarter on strong iPhone 6 demand, according to one well-connected analyst who also expects a busy start to 2015 for the company, with Apple Watch sales in March and a rumored 12-inch MacBook Air coming sometime before April.

In a research note from well-connected KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo obtained by AppleInsider, Apple's latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models led a charge to 73 million overall unit sales for the quarter ending December. The analyst estimates the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 to hit more than 42 million, while the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 6 ""phablet"" contributed with just over 16 million unit sales.

If the numbers hold up, Apple is in for a record-smashing holiday quarter. Kuo's estimates are well above expectations from other leading investment banks including UBS, which earlier this month forecast Apple to sell 69 million iPhones.

Momentum from Apple's iPhone 6 lineup will spill into the first quarter, driving overall iPhone shipments to an about 61.7 million unit sales. A performance of that caliber would buffer seasonally slow sales.

Consistent with the latest reports, Kuo also expects the highly anticipated Apple Watch to launch in March. While Apple has stayed mum on exact specifications, the company could fill in the blanks with a special announcement prior to the device's debut, the analyst said.

Assuming a March launch, Apple Watch is expected to sell 2.8 million units in the first quarter, meaning those sales will be spread across a relatively short one-month span. Kuo says most component suppliers will see shipments in the 4 million to 5 million unit range through the March quarter, but a few manufacturers are seeing low yields on key parts, slowing down final assembly and shipping.

On Apple's rumored 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina display, Kuo is forecasting a ship-by date sometime this quarter. The all-new thin-and-light, said to sport a Retina display, ultra-thin form factor and Intel's latest mobile chips, will help fuel a 2.6-percent quarter-over-quarter increase in Mac shipments. Kuo expects Mac sales to hit 6 million units for the first three months of 2015, up slightly from 5.9 million forecast for Q4 2014.

Aside from industry scuttlebutt, not much is known about Apple's ultraportable newcomer. A set of photos posted online yesterday purportedly show the laptop's display assembly, which boasts edge-to-edge glass with black bezels and eschews the usual translucent Apple logo for a polished insert more in line with the latest iOS devices.

Finally, Kuo sees drooping sell through for iPad as Apple's recently released iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 models largely failed to move the needle during the holiday season. For the December quarter, estimates put iPad shipments down 17.8 percent year-over-year to 21.4 million units. Moving into the first quarter of 2015, iPad could hit 10.1 million unit sales, but the number is still weak, down 38 percent compared to the same time last year.

Interestingly, Kuo models a rise in shipments for older iPad versions during the March quarter while at the same time revising down previous estimates of iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3. The analyst adjusted his numbers to reflect challenges Apple's tablet is facing with shifting market headwinds.","0"
"APPLE WATCH MAY GO ON SALE IN MARCH ACCORDING TO ANALYST","The Apple Watch may hit shelves in March, claims KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo, who also predicts 5 million sales in its first quarter.

Earlier reports, according to MacRumors, support the possible March release date.

Apple first unveiled the Apple Watch last September, a 64-bit smartwatch officially scheduled for an early 2015 release. It will cost $350.

"The World's Most Accurate Apple Analyst Says The Apple Watch Is Coming In March","KGI Securities' Ming Chi Kuo, one of the most accurate analysts when it comes to predicting Apple's product lineup, says the Apple Watch will be released in March, according to MacRumors.

And, Apple is expected to make some announcements about the watch soon.

This follows previous reports from 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman that also said Apple's first wearable will hit store shelves in March.

Although Apple detailed most of the watch's features back in September, Kuo thinks we'll learn even more about the Apple Watch shortly before its release. Apple will offer more specifics on battery life, Kuo says, which has been a point of contention since the watch was announced.

The company previously said you'd have to charge it nightly, but didn't reveal an exact battery life estimate. Gurman reports that Apple is targeting between 2.5 and 4 hours of active use and 19 hours of mixed standby and active use.

This, however, is just a target and could change by the time the watch is actually released.

Apple will also release information regarding Apple Watch preorders before March, according to Kuo, and the company is expected to ship 2.8 million units in the first quarter of 2015.

"Apple Reported to Begin Shipping Apple Watch in March, 12-Inch MacBook Air in Early 2015","Apple will begin shipping the Apple Watch in March and will also look to launch its new 12-inch MacBook Air during this quarter, according to a new report by KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo. The analyst also predicted that iPhone shipments would beat expectations for Q1 2015 with over 61 million units shipped, while iPad shipments are expected to total to 10 million units.

Kuo notes that Apple may reveal more details about the Apple Watch before its official launch, revealing specifics on battery life and the start of pre-orders. Most components of the Apple Watch will see high shipments during the quarter, but other key components are expected to see low production yields which may cause a constrained supply. Kuo predicts that Apple will ship 2.8 million Apple Watch units in Q1 2015, and his estimate for a March launch falls in line with previous reports.

Kuo's estimate for a Q1 2015 launch of the new 12-inch MacBook Air falls in line with a report earlier this month which stated that Apple supplier Quanta Computer was ramping up production of the notebook for a release this quarter. The 12-inch MacBook Air is expected to feature a new ultra-thin, fan-less design with a high resolution Retina display and a low-power Intel Core M processor. The notebook is also said to be one of the first to take advantage of the new reversible USB Type C connector, which may also be used for charging.

"Apple Watch to go on sale in March, claims analyst","The Apple Watch will go on sale in March, and though component shortages may be an issue, about 5 million of the devices are likely to be sold in the first quarter, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo.

Apple hasn’t given a launch date for its first smartwatch, which it unveiled in September, only saying to expect the device in early 2015. In addition to Kuo’s research note, however, other reports also have said the watch will be generally available in March.

Before the device becomes available, Apple will reveal additional information on the watch, including battery specifics and pre-order details, said Kuo, according to a story on the website MacRumors. Apple has said the smartwatch will need nightly recharging, but hasn’t offered other battery information.

Component issues may cause supply problems for the watch, Kuo said. Even with possible component shortages, Apple will sell 2.8 million Apple Watches in March and go on to sell 5 million devices in the first quarter of 2015, he said. Kuo called for iPhone shipments for that quarter to exceed 61 million units and iPad shipments to come in at 10 million units.

Apple will also launch a 12-inch MacBook Air that quarter, said Kuo. The ultra-thin notebook will run Intel’s Core M chip and feature the high resolution Retina display.","0"
"New report tips Apple Watch release in March, 12in MacBook Air in Q1","Our 2015 calendars are about to turn over to February and there's still no confirmed launched date for the Apple Watch. As a result, speculation on when the touchscreen wearable will hit shelves is beginning to reach a fervor. Fear not, however, as Ming-Chi Kuo, the analyst with a mostly reliable track record, is here to contribute to the prediction that the Apple Watch will begin shipping in March. Even more, Kuo says the much-discussed 12-inch MacBook Air will launch before the end of 2015's first quarter.

As an analyst for KGI Securities, Kuo's latest report says that before the Apple Watch's official release, Apple may announce additional details about the device (that's a big ""no duh""), including battery life specifics and when pre-orders will begin. He predicts that while components for the Apple Watch will see high shipments throughout the first quarter, initial production numbers will be low and a high customer demand will make the product hard to find. Kuo forecasts there will be 2.8 million Apple Watch shipments during the first quarter of 2015.

As for the new 12-inch MacBook Air, the analyst says the ultra-thin laptop will make its debut before the end of the current quarter, with additional information saying that Quanta Computer, an Apple supplier, has already begun increasing production. As a brand new entry to the MacBook Air line, the 12-inch model has long been suggested to feature a Retina display and an even thinner design, while recent rumors have pegged the notebook to ship with only a headphone jack and a single new reversible USB Type-C connector that will be used for charging.

A release date for the new MacBook Air within the current quarter definitely seems soon, but an alleged leak of the laptop's display only days ago could back up Kuo's claim of production having already begun. As for his prediction of a March release for the Apple Watch, that seems like a pretty safe bet, since Apple's own website says the device is ""coming early 2015."" We'll just have to wait to see if the wearable actually ships that month, of if that's just when pre-orders will begin.

"Apple Watch on Your Wrist in March, 12-inch MacBook Air Set for Q1 Launch: Analyst","iFans can look forward to the much-awaited smartwatch from Apple making its debut this March if analysts' predictions prove true. That's not all: the 12-inch MacBook Air is also gearing up to launch in the first quarter.

According to a research note from Ming-Chi Kuo, analyst with KGI Securities, the Apple Watch will begin shipping by March. Kuo's forecast is in keeping with recent reports that predict the same release date. He also noted that Apple may hold a special event to unveil the details of the smartwatch, whose specifications are not yet clearly known.

Kuo also predicted that Apple will release the new 12-inch MacBook Air in Q1 2015.

The Apple Watch is also anticipated to sell 2.8 million units in the first quarter -- that is the first month alone -- in the event that there is a March launch.

According to Kuo, shipments in the range of 4 million to 5 million will be seen by most component suppliers in March. However, a few components may also see low production yields, which could affect the assembly and shipping.

Kuo also forecast that the much-rumored 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina display will also ship in the same quarter, which is in synergy with other rumors. A report earlier inJanuary suggested that Quanta Computer, an Apple supplier, was beefing up production of the notebook to meet the Q1 2015 release deadline. The ultra-thin MacBook Air is rumored to tout a fan-less design and pack in the latest low-power processor from Intel (Core M). It is also expected to boast a high resolution Retina display and may be the first to incorporate the USB Type C connector which is reversible. This may also be used for charging the device.

Per Kuo, MacBook Air sales will likely touch the 6 million units sales mark (for the first three months of 2015), which is an increase from the 5.9 million forecast in Q1 2014.

The analyst sees iPhone shipments touch 61.7 million unit sales in Q1 2015. Kuo also anticipates a drop in demand for the iPad as the latest iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 tablets did not create much of a stir in the holiday season.","0"
"Analyst “Confirms” Apple Watch And 12-inch MacBook Air’s Q1 2015 Launch","In Q1 2015, we expect that Apple could very well release at least two new products – the Apple Watch and the 12-inch MacBook Air. We have heard two separate rumors that the former will be launched in March and the latter will see a general Q1 2015 release, but if you’re still a little skeptical, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has basically “confirmed” it.
Kuo has been known for his pretty accurate predictions regarding Apple’s product lineup and their release timeframes, so there could be some truth in his claims. According to Kuo, he confirms that Apple will indeed be releasing the Apple Watch in March and the upcoming 12-inch MacBook Air later on in the quarter as well, but no specific dates were provided.
According to Kuo, the Apple Watch could see some supply constraint. This is due to key components of the wearable having low production yields, but Kuo notes that this is not an issue for the other components which should see high shipments in this quarter. He also expects that Apple will ship 2.5 million Apple Watch units in Q1 2015 alone.
Kuo also predicts that Apple will reveal more details about the Apple Watch ahead of its release and offer up more detailed information about its battery life and when pre-orders will begin, which we guess sounds pretty probable. However as is the case with all rumors, they’re best taken with a grain of salt for now, but do check back with us in the coming weeks/months where hopefully we will have more details for you.","0"
"Werewolf Legend Leads To Jewish Godson's 'Adoption' by Argentina President","Argentina’s president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves.
President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.
He was adopted as a godson under a law passed in the 1920s. The law was passed in order to counteract a legend that led to the death of Argentine boys. According to the legend, the seventh son, born after six boys without any girls in-between, becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf.
The belief in the legend was so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.
The law only applied to the biological children of Catholic families until the enacting of a presidential decree in 2009, which allows children from other religions to qualify.
The boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until his 21st birthday.
Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree, and asking for the designation of godson.
Yair Tawil on Tuesday became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina’s history. Fernandez received the Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together on a Hanukkah menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family.
The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers the “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”
She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.

"President of Argentina adopts godson to stop him from turning into a werewolf","The President of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, has adopted a Jewish godson – to prevent him from becoming a werewolf.

Although this sounds like something straight out of a fantasy novel, the President last week met Yair Tawil and his family for the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years and is based on Argentinian folklore.

According to the legend, the seventh son of a family will transform into ‘El Lobison’, a werewolf like creature, on the first Friday after the boy’s 13th Birthday, and will continue to turn into a blood-thirsty, baby eating werewolf every full moon.

The fear of the creature was so fervent in 19th century Argentina that many families murdered or abandoned their seventh born son, forcing the Argentinian government to implement the process of Presidential adoption.

The tradition was established in 1907, and was extended to baby girls in 1973.

Although having seven children is now much rarer than 100 years ago, seventh sons or daughters can now expect to gain the President as their official godparent, as well as a gold medal and educational scholarship.

The President has said that Yair is the first Jewish boy to take part in the ceremony, as the tradition was exclusive to Catholic children until 2009.","0"

This may sound familiar to fans of 30 Rock:

Wait, what? According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared ""el lobizon,"" the Independent explains. The werewolf-like beast ""shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy's 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.""

The legend seems ridiculous, but the Independent reports that fear of the creature was so widespread in 19th century Argentina that some families even murdered their babies. Fear and panic gave rise to the unusual practice of adoption by Argentina's president in 1907, which is meant to quell the deadly stigma ad demystify the folklore that was causing the abuse of children. Now a time-honored tradition, any family with seven sons or daughters today gets the president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.


The boy's parents, Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, had written the president's office requesting the adoption in 1993, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported. President Kirchner reportedly described the adoption as a ""magical moment,"" calling the Tawils a ""marvelous family.""

"Argentina’s President Adopted A Jewish Godson To Stop Him From Turning Into A Werewolf","Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced on Dec. 23 that she had adopted a young Jewish man as her godson to prevent him from turning into a werewolf-like creature.

According to Argentine folklore, the seventh son of a family will turn into a werewolf-like creature called “el lobizón” when he turns 13. The lobizón feeds on excrement and unbaptized babies.

The Argentine president will now become the official godparent of any family that has seven sons or daughters. The tradition dates back to 1907. In 1973, the Argentine government extended it to baby girls.

Mágico fue recibir a Iair Tawil, 1er ahijado presidencial de nuestra historia que profesa la fe judía.

Yair Tawil, Kirchner’s newest godson, is the first Jewish person to be adopted, however. Kirchner said the tradition only included Catholics until 2009.

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad…

The ceremony began in 1907 in an effort to demystify the folklore and prevent the abuse of children, but has since become a time-honored tradition. The anti-lobizón adoption ceremony also includes a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.

Under a law the country has followed since the 1920s to counteract a generations-old legend, Fernandez adopted Yail Tawil, her godson who was destined, as the seventh son of his family, to become a werewolf, according to various published reports and the president's own tweets.

The happy family:

Argentina passed the law because the belief in the curse became so widespread that families were abandoning, putting up for adoption and in some cases killing their seventh sons, according to The Jerusalem Post.

Tawil's parents wrote Fernandez a letter asking her to take on Tawil as her godson, to which she agreed in a ceremony she described to her Twitter followers as ""magical.""

It's actually part of a long-standing tradition stemming from Argentinian folklore that says the seventh son in families with no girls are doomed to turn into ""el lobison,"" a werewolf who feeds on unbaptized babies and whose bites could turn others into werewolves. Belief in the legend was once reportedly so widespread that families were abandoning their seventh sons, giving them up for adoption, or killing them. 

A law was passed in the 1920s to counteract the effect (the law was expanded in 2009 to include girls and non-Catholic children), and now, every year, the president formally adopts a boy or girl as his or her godchild, awarding him or her a medal, ""presidential protection,"" and a scholarship to study until the godchild turns 21.

This year, Fernandez de Kirchner formally adopted Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. In 1993, Yair's parents reportedly wrote to the president asking for the honor and were denied, but this year, Yair wrote to Fernandez de Kirchner himself and got his wish, making him the first Jewish boy in Argentina to be officially adopted by the president.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers the “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”

She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.

Hmmm, let us explain.

According to an old Argentinian legend, the seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between is liable to turn into one of the mythical creatures.

Fear was so rife in the country that families would often give up their seventh-born sons for adoption or even kill them.

In the 1920s a law was passed to counteract the legend. It offered presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday but only for Catholic families.

"President of Argentina adopts Jewish boy to stop him turning into werewolf","As traditions go this may be the most unbelievable tale you may ever read - the President of Argentina has adopted a Jewish boy as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.

Christina Fernandez de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family last week at her office to mark the 100-year-old Argentine custom.

According to legend the seventh son born to a family turns into a ferocious ""el lobison"" or werewolf – on the first Friday after his 13th birthday.

The country began to introduce adoption procedures to quell the fear of the people in the 19th century who believed their sons could turn into werewolfs (the fear was so extreme in some cases people murdered their baby boys).

It has become customary since 1907 but formally established in 1973 for the president to adopt their seventh sons and daughters who also receive a gold medal and full educational scholarship.

Tawil's parents wrote to the president in 1993 for their son to be the first Jewish boy to be adopted and they got their wish this year, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

Until 2009, the tradition only applied to Catholic children.

Last week's unusual ceremony between the president and Tawil, witnessed by his parents and three brothers, happened at the same time as Hanukkah - the eight-day Jewish festival that commemorates the rededication of the holy Temple in Jerusalem in 165 BC.

Fernandez de Kirchner tweeted: ""I didn't know it but his visit coincided with the Hanukkah celebration. The father said it wasn't a coincidence.""

"Argentina’s president adopts Jewish godson to counteract werewolf legend","BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (JTA) — Argentina’s president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves.
President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.
Tawil was adopted under a law passed in the 1920s to counteract a legend that a seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf. Belief in the legend was once so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.
Under the law, the boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday. Until 2009, the law only applied to Catholic boys.
Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.

"Argentina's President Adopts Boy to End Werewolf Curse","Argentina's President Christina Fernández de Kirchner had a ""magical moment"" last week when she ended a young man's werewolf curse — that is, if you believe South American folklore.

Kirchner shared photos from a Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony on her blog, and described ""adopting"" a young man named Yair Tawil. He is the seventh son of his family, and because of that, was supposedly cursed to become a werewolf on every full moon after his 13th birthday — unless he is adopted by another family. According to legend, seventh daughters become witches.

Enter Argentina's presidents, who since 1907 have been adopting — symbolically, anyway — seventh children so that their families can avoid the superstitious stigma of having a ""cursed"" child. The practice has traditionally involved Catholic children, but that was changed by presidential decree in 2009.

Under Argentine law, seventh children adopted by the president receive a gold medal and an education scholarship until they turn 21. Last Tuesday's ritual was the first time someone of the Jewish faith was adopted by a president. Yair's parents, Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, had first written a letter asking that their seventh son be adopted in 1993, when he was born, reported the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

"Argentina president adopts young Jewish boy as godson to prevent him from turning into werewolf","President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchhner adopted Yair Tawil as her godson, due to an Argentine folktale that says the seventh born son in a family will turn into a werewolf, and eat unbaptized babies.

Argentina's president has adopted a young Jewish boy as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.

Yair Tawil was adopted in a ceremony which took place because of Argentinian folklore, reports the Independent.

He is the first Jewish boy to be adopted, as the practice only applied to Catholics until 2009.

According to tradition in the country, the seventh son born to a family turns into a werewolf, a feared ""el lobison"".

The creature only shows its true nature on the first Friday after the boy's 13th birthday, turning the teenager into a demon at midnight during every full moon.

Legend has it that the lobison feeds on unbaptized babies.

Although the story may now seem fanciful, fear of the werewolf-like creature was so widespread in 19th century Argentina that some families even murdered their babies.

To stop the practice happening the Argentine president began adopting babies.

Any family now which has seven sons or daughters get the president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship, reports the Independent.

"Argentina's President Adopts Jewish Boy to Keep Him from Turning into a Werewolf","Argentina's President Christina Fernández de Kirchner has a pretty solid plan for keeping her country safe from werewolves: She's going to adopt them. 

There's apparently an obscure bit of Argentinian folklore that states the seventh son born to a family will turn into the feared el lobison on the first Friday after the boy's 13th birthday. The myth predicts the child will transform into a creature at midnight during each full moon, eternally damned to ravage the countryside before returning to human form. 

Other fun bits of el lobison trivia, per The Independent: They feed on excrement, unbaptized babies and the flesh of the recently dead; they're unnaturally strong; and they can spread their curse by biting. 

The fear of el lobison's curse was so strong in Argentina that families abandoned – or in some cases murdered – their seventh son in the 19th century, which is how the tradition of the sitting president adopting one of these children came to pass in 1907. It was formally decreed in 1973 by then-president Juan Domingo Perón, and extended to baby girls at that time. Those adopted gain the sitting president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship. 




This year, Kirchner adopted the first Jewish seventh son, Yair Tawil. The practice had extended only to Catholic children until 2009. Kirchner met with Yair and his parents, Shlomo and Nehama, on Dec. 23. She called the family ""marvelous,"" described Yair as ""a total sweetie,"" and bestowed the presidential nickname of ""Queen Esther"" on Nehama.

"Argentina Has a Superstition That Seventh Sons Will Turn into Werewolves","Christina Fernández de Kirchner, the president of Argentina, got a new addition to her family last week when she adopted a 13-year-old Jewish boy named Yair Tawil as her godson, the Independent reports. Her motivations for doing so are based on a centuries-old legend that seventh sons will transform into werewolves.

In Argentina, the werewolf is referred to as el lobison; in Paraguay it goes by the name Luison, and in Brazil it's called the Lobisomem. The Independent elaborates on the South American legend: 

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

In Guaraní mythology, the lobison is the offspring of Tau, an evil spirit, and Kerana, a mortal woman. In the cultures that believe in the lobison, that creature acts as a sort of Grim Reaper, whose mere presence means that death will soon befall those it comes into contact with. As the Independent explains, by the 19th century, fear of this creature was so acute in Argentina that families sometimes murdered their seventh sons to prevent the legend from coming true. So in 1907, in an attempt to stop this practice, the Argentinean president began adopting seventh sons, which the president insisted would stop the curse. In 1973, the Independent adds, the presidential adoption tradition was also extended to seventh daughters. 

In addition to being able to say he's the president's godson, Tawil will receive a gold medal and enjoy a full educational scholarship. In modern times, the curse, it seems, is more aptly described as a blessing.","0"
"Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner adopts Jewish boy to protect him from werewolf stigma","BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 29 (UPI) -- Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner adopted Jewish boy Yair Tawil as her godson to protect him from the stigma of a folk tale prophesying he will turn into a werewolf.
In Argentina, there is a legend the seventh son born to a family with no daughters will turn into ""el lobison"" or a werewolf upon his 13th birthday. The legend became so feared that families would abandon or kill their sons. To counteract this stigma, the president of Argentina began in 1907 to adopt one of the boys as their godson.

Tawil is the first Jewish godson as the honor only applied to Catholic boys until 2009. His parents asked for the honor in 1993 but were denied. He appealed to Kirchner, citing the 2009 decree and was accepted as the candidate.

"Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents","Last week, President Cristina Kirchner adopted a Jewish teenager named Yair Tawil and posted pictures of the event on her Twitter feed. Outlets around the world ran with the story, explaining the move by citing lingering local superstition about werewolves. In Western folklore, only a werewolf can create another werewolf with its bite, but in Argentina, the story's a little different: the creature is born when a couple gives birth to their seventh son in a row. According to said folklore, seventh sons turn into el lobizon on their 13th birthday if nothing is done about the hereditary curse. Thus, the need for presidential action is pretty clear.

""The notion of animal shifting came from different Native American traditions,"" Oscar Chamosa, a folklorist at the University of Georgia, told me. ""The idea of el lobison comes from uturunco—or the were-jaguar—which mixed with the European notion of the werewolf."" Chamosa says he's not sure how the idea was first associated with teenaged boys.

But even if someone who's devoted his entire life to studying Argentine folklore can't explain it, the teen werewolf thing had become pervasive by the early 20th century, and Catholics in Argentina were producing enough seventh children, that the myth became a public policy problem. After all, terrified parents were (according to legend, at least) regularly committing infanticide.

""In order to counteract the myth, Argentine presidents have traditionally godfathered any child born into the same family,"" Chamosa explains, adding that the governor of a province or mayor of a village would sometimes officiate for practical reasons. ""The rationale is that the godson of a president would be respected throughout his life despite the suspicion his seventh-male birth position would bring with it.""

This idea apparently prevented people from murdering their own babies, so it was a smart move on part of the Argentine government. But if it's surprising people believed in such a curse a century ago, it's downright bizarre that they're still entertaining the notion of it today.

As per a decree that came out in 1973, adoptees receive a gold medal and a college scholarship. And Argentina is apparently still making new rules about werewolf children, because in 1999 the adoption ceremony was extended to non-Catholics. As the Independent noted, Tawil is the first Jewish boy to receive the honor. So while a werewolf Bar Mitzvah might be a joke on 30 Rock, it's also apparently a real thing that just happened in South America.

The boy's parents first applied for the medal and scholarship in 1993, but were denied. They applied again after the rules changed to include Jews in 2009. A tweet from President Kirchner's account shows her lighting a menorah with the Tawils, quite the gesture given that the Jewish population of Argentina is less than half of one percent.

Jewishpublications are making a big deal out of the historic event, and angry commenters are freaking out about a Jew being adopted—even symbolically—by a non-Jew and the blasphemous concept of a Jewish family taking part in something involving werewolves. (In Jewish folklore, people don't turn into werewolves, and whatever they were before beasthood is never really discussed.)

But most observers have been glossing over the absolutely fucking strange juxtaposition between a groundbreaking event and an ancient superstition. Like, for instance, that's it's kind of a weird move to progressively bequeath a privilege to a religious minority while tacitly legitimizing the belief that human beings have the ability to transform into mythical creatures that feast on unbaptized babies.

Stories about the adoption would also have us believe the president of an industrialized nation believes in werewolves, which is clearly not the case. Although presidents in our own country's recent memory believed they were chosen by God, Chamosa describes Argentina's Kirchner as a nominal Catholic who's a ""progressive left-wing president—more like a Marxist and a secular person in general."" Much as our Dear Leader pardons a turkey every year, this is an Argentine ritual that's basically a national inside joke.

Chamosa says that the werewolf thing has stuck around out of quaint tradition and that the average family in the country today has only two children. For that reason, anyone who achieves an unbroken chain of seven same-sex children is rewarded with the prize.

Of course, that doesn't mean there aren't some people in Latin America who still believe in el lobizon.

""Belief in the healing powers of folk saints and withcraft are pretty much shared across the territory, especially—but not only—in rural areas,"" Chamosa says. ""I would say that only old people still believe [in el lobison]. But you really don't know.""

"Did Argentina’s president ‘adopt’ a Jewish boy to save him from life as a ‘werewolf’?","Last week, Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner ""adopted"" a boy as her godson to prevent him from turning into a werewolf, according to multiple news reports. A report in the Guardian subsequently deemed the story spurious.

Kirchner tweeted images of a small ceremony conducted with the family of Yair Tawil, the seventh child of an Argentine Jewish family, during which the Tawils met with the president and lit candles on a menorah. She was adopting the child as her godson, a symbolic gesture made by generations of Argentine leaders over the years.

According to the Independent, tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf — known as ""el lobison"" in Argentina — after his 13th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form. The legend stems from indigenous folklore and melded with superstitions of European settlers in the 19th century. The fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born, which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing.

In the past half-century, the ceremonies have been opened up to girls and now, for the first time, Jews. The Tawil family appealed to the Argentine government as early as the 1990s to have the practice extended to non-Catholic families. The boy's new status as the president's godson wins him a gold medal as well as a full educational scholarship, according to the Independent.

Tales of shape-shifting demons and feral monsters slaughtering livestock can be found in many parts of Latin America. This Argentine iteration can be traced to a local Guarani story of the seven cursed spawn of Tau, an evil mythological spirit, and Kerana, a beautiful woman he seduced and kidnapped. The seventh son was ""Luison,"" who appears sometimes in the shape of a small dog and feeds on corpses.

But, citing an Argentine historian, the Guardian disputes the connection between beliefs about this folk horror and the presidential act of adopting a seventh son as a godson, and says the latter is a distinct custom brought over by Eastern European migrants. In updates posted to their Web sites, both the Independent and Buzzfeed say European folklore surrounding seventh sons included fears of the child turning into a monster.

In any case, Americans should not be so quick to scoff at the tradition and its embrace by Argentina's head of state, in whatever form. After all, the U.S. president participates in the ritual pardoning of a fluffy and presumably bewildered animal every year.

"Graffiti Artist Banksy Arrested In London; Identity Revealed","London, England — The elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London’s Metropolitan Police. After hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed.

The City of London Police say Banksy’s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. The BBC has confirmed this information with Banky’s PR agent Jo Brooks along with Pest Control, a website that acts as a handling service on behalf of the artist.

London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run.

“We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky’s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,” Edwards said. “We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.” Edwards continued, “Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.”

Horner was arrested by London Police in Watford, a town and borough in Hertfordshire, England, about 17 miles northwest of central London.

The graffiti artist that goes by the name Space Invader told reporters he does not agree with the arrest or outing of Banksy’s identity.

“He’s just doing art, spreading joy and making political statements the best way he knows how. That is what he was doing and I hope that is what he’ll continue to do,” Invader said. “For the London Police to setup some 24-hour task force just to catch Banksy is ridiculous. I hope we hear plenty of noise from the good tax-paying citizens of London about this.”

After today’s arrest it is unclear who else will be sought in connection with Banksy’s arrest. CNN spoke with John Hawes who is a project manager for Banksy says he is worried that charges could be brought against him also.

“If they spent this many man-hours and brought this many charges against Banksy, I can’t imagine that he’ll be the only one to go down in all of this,” Hawes said. “All the beauty Paul Horner brought to this world, unfortunately the London Police just see it as vandalism and want to lock him up. It’s such a shame.”

Banksy’s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.

Police apprehended the famous street artist while in the middle of finishing a piece about a mascot for a Christian organization named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.

“I’m just happy to be a part of this whole thing,” Fappy told CNN. “I’m not familiar with this Banksy character, honestly if it’s not in the Bible I probably haven’t heard of it, but if this arrest spreads awareness of the harmful effects of self-rape, then that is a good thing. Hopefully news of this ordeal will bring the much needed attention to the dangers and consequences of playing with your sin stick or ringing the Devil’s doorbell. Hopefully, God willing, one day, masturbation will be illegal and people will finally be free of playing on the Devil’s playground.”

Local resident 27-year old Matthew Williams told reporters he was disgusted when he heard news of the arrest.

“What a waste of taxpayers money. Wouldn’t it be better spent fighting the war against drugs or violence ? What harm has this man done except produce beautiful thought provoking artwork? The counterfeit money thing has either been planted or its part if his art and not actual real counterfeit cash.” Williams continued, “This is just another move by the Five-Oh to crush anything good and free. People need to work out what side they’re on and if they’re on the side of beauty and freedom, they need to start fighting back. There are simply not enough heroes like Banksy to do it for you. I hope this blows up in the cops’ faces and the rest of the government as well.”

“People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.

F*ck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.

You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.”

In 2011, Banksy was a no-show to accept his Oscar for his documentary Exit The Gift Shop, though his artwork was seen all over Hollywood in days leading up to the awards.

As soon as news of the arrest was made, the City of London Police say they began receiving dozens of phone calls from people either claiming to be Banksy, or claiming to be with him. As of 6 PM London time, hundreds of people were gathered outside the London Police Department chanting “I’m Banksy!” and holding signs demanding his release.

"Graffiti Artist Banksy Arrested In London; Identity Revealed - See more at: http://nationalreport.net/banksy-arrested-identity-revealed/#sthash.JBpE0Utc.DSzOJ8Zl.dpuf","London, England — The elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London’s Metropolitan Police. After hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed.
The City of London Police say Banksy’s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. The BBC has confirmed this information with Banky’s PR agent Jo Brooks along with Pest Control, a website that acts as a handling service on behalf of the artist.
London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run.
“We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky’s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,” Edwards said. “We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.” Edwards continued, “Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.”
Horner was arrested by London Police in Watford, a town and borough in Hertfordshire, England, about 17 miles northwest of central London.


 
The graffiti artist that goes by the name Space Invader told reporters he does not agree with the arrest or outing of Banksy’s identity.
“He’s just doing art, spreading joy and making political statements the best way he knows how. That is what he was doing and I hope that is what he’ll continue to do,” Invader said. “For the London Police to setup some 24-hour task force just to catch Banksy is ridiculous. I hope we hear plenty of noise from the good tax-paying citizens of London about this.”
After today’s arrest it is unclear who else will be sought in connection with Banksy’s arrest. CNN spoke with John Hawes who is a project manager for Banksy says he is worried that charges could be brought against him also.
“If they spent this many man-hours and brought this many charges against Banksy, I can’t imagine that he’ll be the only one to go down in all of this,” Hawes said. “All the beauty Paul Horner brought to this world, unfortunately the London Police just see it as vandalism and want to lock him up. It’s such a shame.”

Banksy’s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.
Police apprehended the famous street artist while in the middle of finishing a piece about a mascot for a Christian organization named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.
“I’m just happy to be a part of this whole thing,” Fappy told CNN. “I’m not familiar with this Banksy character, honestly if it’s not in the Bible I probably haven’t heard of it, but if this arrest spreads awareness of the harmful effects of self-rape, then that is a good thing. Hopefully news of this ordeal will bring the much needed attention to the dangers and consequences of playing with your sin stick or ringing the Devil’s doorbell. Hopefully, God willing, one day, masturbation will be illegal and people will finally be free of playing on the Devil’s playground.”

Local resident 27-year old Matthew Williams told reporters he was disgusted when he heard news of the arrest.
“What a waste of taxpayers money. Wouldn’t it be better spent fighting the war against drugs or violence ? What harm has this man done except produce beautiful thought provoking artwork? The counterfeit money thing has either been planted or its part if his art and not actual real counterfeit cash.” Williams continued, “This is just another move by the Five-Oh to crush anything good and free. People need to work out what side they’re on and if they’re on the side of beauty and freedom, they need to start fighting back. There are simply not enough heroes like Banksy to do it for you. I hope this blows up in the cops’ faces and the rest of the government as well.”
One Of The More Memorable Quotes By Banksy
“People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.
F*ck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.
You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.”

"Popular 'Banksy' Instagram account offers powerful message of perseverance after Paris attack","Editors' note: This image, which is unique according to a reverse image search done on Tin Eye, was posted on the @Banksy Instagram account to its nearly 1 million followers. It is not, however, confirmed to be an official account operated by the artist. It could be Banksy, but the artist's real accounts are unclear. We've changed the headline and story below to reflect that.

A popular Banksy Instagram account weighed in on Wednesday with a powerful homage to the murdered journalists at the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo, victims of a horrific terror attack.

Take a look:

A photo posted by Banksy (@banksy) on Jan 1, 2015 at 3:02pm PST

The account, which has nearly one million followers — though it is not known to be an official Banksy Instagram account — posted a picture on featuring three pencils — the pencil fully intact is next to the word ""yesterday,"" a broken pencil represents ""today,"" and the resharpened shard shows there will be two pencils ""tomorrow.""

It adds: ""RIP,"" joining scores of other cartoonists and artists who have been sharing tributes throughout the day.

Twelve people were killed in what France's president called a ""terror attack"" on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday, leading authorities to launch a massive manhunt for the gunmen, who remain at large. No arrests have been confirmed in the hunt for the attackers, though an ""anti-terror raid"" is reportedly underway in the northeastern city of Reims.

The brothers, caught on tape by an eyewitness, shouted ""Allahu akbar!"" as they walked outside the building carrying large guns and dressed entirely in black. The magazine staff was in an editorial meeting, around lunchtime in Paris, when the gunmen opened fire. Eleven others were wounded; four of those injuries are serious.

Witnesses described the gunmen as speaking perfect French.

Charlie Hebdo has frequently drawn condemnation from Muslims. In 2011, the magazine was firebombed after it ran a cartoon depicting the Prophet Muḥammad.

The editor in charge of the paper was one of those killed on Wednesday. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, though supporters of militant groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda praised the attack online. World leaders condemned it as an attack on freedom of expression.

"'Banksy' Reacts To Paris Attack With Poignant Drawing","Banksy appears to have shared a message of sorrow and hope Wednesday after an attack on the Paris office of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo left 12 people dead.

The drawing was shared from an Instagram account and Facebook page that many believe are associated with the enigmatic street artist. Both posts carried only the message ""RIP"".

banksy paris charlie hebdo


That said, there is debate about the authenticity of the image. The page the drawing was shared from was initially verified by Facebook, but that verification was later removed. Banksy's publicist Jo Brooks told Animal New York that the page is ""100 per cent fake"" and the artist's website says Banksy is ""not on Facebook and has never used Twitter.""

Many have speculated, however, that the denials are all part of cultivating Banksy's puzzling persona.

The Guardian and Mashable both identified the Instagram post as being authentic, but Mashable later updated its story to reflect doubts about the image's authenticity. In 2013 The New York Times identified a different Instagram account as being linked to the artist.

Regardless of whether the real Banksy is behind the drawing, there's no denying it's a powerful image.","0"
"Holy Theft! Batmobile Stolen from 'Batman v Superman'???","Ok, this is all still rumor, but there’s a chance a Batmobile was stolen from the set of Batman v Superman set in Detroit. My former employer Bleeding Cool posted this:
The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen.

It would not be the first time a Batmobile has been nicked in Detroit. Though that was just a $200 replica of the TV Series version back in 2o10.

So far we have no clue or confirmation, but if this is true, we should quickly form a list of suspects. My money is on King Tut.

"Batmobile Rumored To Have Been Stolen From Batman V. Superman: Dawn Of Justice Set","Rumors have hit social media that the Batmobile has been stolen from the Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice set in Detroit. While on the face of it the idea that someone could actually make off with a Batmobile from the heavily-secured set seem somewhat ludicrous, the local Michigan media seems to be taking the reports seriously enough that the police department has been contacted to look into it.

CBS Detroit notes in their report, “Does this person — if the rumor is true (we don’t know how credible the source is) — think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?” WWJ950 tweets, “Was The Batmobile Stolen In #Detroit? Unconfirmed Rumors Are Swirling, And Police Tell WWJ They'll Look Into It.”

Of course, it’s a little unclear from the tweet if the police department is actually looking into the disappearance of the Batmobile or is just looking into the source of the unconfirmed rumors. Most sites seem to be pointing to Bleeding Cool as the source of the rumors, which they report as having heard from sources in Detroit.

Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice is scheduled to be released in movie theaters on March 25, 2016.","0"
"Was The Batmobile Stolen In Detroit?","Only in Detroit? Holy stolen Batmobile, Batman…
A website is reporting that the Batmobile, from the upcoming Batman v. Superman flick, has gone missing in Detroit… and is presumed stolen.
If this is true I could only imagine seeing it driving down 696 in rush hour.
Seriously, how the heck could someone steal this car? It’s not like it’s a 2008 Sebring that you could mix up with just about any other Sebring. No, it’s the BATMOBILE! It has machine guns in the front.
Does this person — if the rumor is true (we don’t know how credible the source is) — think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?
If I see the Batmobile driving around anywhere I am taking photos. Even funnier: Could you imagine getting pulled over for going too slow in this car? No way right?
How would the cops catch it with all the Bat devices that come standard? Does Alfred come to your rescue? Is the Batcave set in the GPS? If so you would be safe from the cops, I presume…
Our brother station WWJ put a call into the Detroit Police Department to see if there is any truth to this. (Update! As of 4 p.m., police were saying they hadn’t heard about this, but were looking into it).
I hope Commissioner Gordon is on the case, too.
Earlier this week photos of the Batmobile surfaced. You think if the photos didn’t surface than people would just think it’s a Corvette rolling down the street? Maybe not.","0"
"REPORT: The Batmobile Might Have Been Stolen In Detroit","It can't be possible. I refuse to believe it. But there are reports circling that the Batmobile has been stolen from the set of Batman Vs. Superman in Detroit.
Details are scarce and nothing is confirmed. Bleeding Cool, which first reported on the caped crusader's missing machine, reached out to Warner Bros. but the studio hasn't responded. CBS in Detroit has contacted the local police department and they're looking into it.

Again, this is probably bogus, but if it isn't, keep your eyes peeled for something dark, menacing, and with freaking machine guns on its nose.","0"
"BATMAN VS. SUPERMAN BATMOBILE STOLEN","It's being reported that one of the Batmobiles that are currently in Detroit for Batman Vs. Superman has been stolen.

Details are slim as Bleeding Cool mentions they heard it, but not from whom, and they state WB hasn't responded to inquires.

It's known that there are at two versions of the Batmobile in Detroit as two were spotted recently under a tarp.

Cosmic Book News will update when more becomes available.

This isn't the first time the film has had issues in Detroit as reportedly Henry Cavill almost got into a fight with a bunch of Detroit locals at a bar that dub themselves the ""Deaf Wolfpack.""
""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" has a March 25, 2016 release starring Ben Affleck as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Jeremy Irons as Alfred, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, Ray Fisher as Cyborg with Callan Mulvey, Holly Hunter and Tao Okamoto in new character roles for the film.

"At CBS Detroit, Fan Site 'Scuttlebutt' Is Enough to Publish Batmobile Rumor","Holy crap, Batman -- look what happened to a a once-distinguished news organization.

The CBS Detroit broadcast group's website posts a 10-paragraph article, if that's the right word, about something that may or may not have happened:

A website is reporting that the Batmobile, from the upcoming Batman v. Superman flick, has gone missing in Detroit and is presumed stolen.  

Sounds serious and dramatic. And yet no other local media outlet has a word about it. 

Further reading suggests why.

""Presumed stolen"" refers to a presumption by the anonymous writer of a four-paragraph post at Bleeding Cool, an Illinois site for comic book fans. Its brief item begins:

The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen. 

That site adds: ""Warner Bros representatives did not respond to inquiries.""
The CBS Detroit writer, Evan Jankens, also makes a nod to verification:

Our brother station WWJ put a call into the Detroit Police Department to see if there is any truth to this. (Update! As of 4 p.m., police were saying they hadn’t heard about this, but were looking into it).

Members of the broadcast group are WWJ-TV (Channel 62), WWJ Newsradio 950 and two sports radio stations.

Absent any confirmation, Jankens riffs speculatively on the notion of a possible Batmobile-jacking:

If this is true I could only imagine seeing it driving down 696 in rush hour.
Seriously, how the heck could someone steal this car? . . . No, it’s the BATMOBILE! It has machine guns in the front.
Does this person — if the rumor is true (we don’t know how credible the source is) — think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?
Hey, we like Friday afternoon playfulness as much as the next keyboard jockey, but stay on the other side of publishing a story from someone else's anonymous source that requires disclaimers such as ""if the rumor is true"" and ""we don't know how credible the source is.""

That wouldn't slide past a high school student publication adviser and it seems like a disservice to readers of CBS Detroit, which didn't share the wispy piece on its Facebook pages and presumably not on its newscasts.

The contrasting tweets below show two approaches to the Bleeding Cool short. The first was sent by CBS Detroit's writer to the film director after publication, while the second was posted instead of a preliminary article.","0"
"Batmobile Stolen From 'Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice' Set? Report Claims That One Of The Batmobile Models Is Missing! Detroit Locals Responsible?","In a bizarre twist during the filming of ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"" in Detroit, the Batmobile (or at least one of the models) is missing! The initial assumption based on the report is that Detroit locals may have stolen it!
All initial reports point to Bleeding Cool as the primary source of the report. They did not give any specific details:
""The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of 'Batman Vs. Superman' has gone missing, believed stolen.
Warner Bros representatives did not respond to inquiries.""
The website is one of the known super hero movie sites and has been accurate in some of their scoops. However, there is no way to determine the accuracy of this claim except through the police.
One of the local radio stations affiliated with CBS Detroit Local did just that. The result along with CBS Detroit's report:
""Does this person - if the rumor is true (we don't know how credible the source is) - think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?

This news shouldn't bring me so much joy, but Bleeding Cool rumormonger Rich Johnston is reporting that the Batmobile, or at least one of the Batmobiles used for filming Superman v. Batman: Paths of Glory, has been stolen. The movie is being filmed in Detroit, which hasn't been going through the best times of late. There's no official confirmation yet, but hey, maybe somebody needed it to drive out of town to get some fucking water.

"Boston.com pulls story accusing prof of sending ‘racist’ emails","The Boston Globe’s Boston.com last night pulled a story off its website that alleged a Harvard Business School professor had sent “racist” emails to the owner of a Chinese restaurant with whom he had a dispute over $4 on his bill.

Boston.com has taken professor Ben Edelman to task over the dispute in a series of stories. Last night, the website posted a story headlined: “Ben Edelman Appears to Have Sent Racist Email to Chinese Restaurant Owner. Today.”

“Could it be Harvard Business School Professor Ben Edelman has a problem with people of Asian descent?” the story said. It also included what purported to be the text of emails from Edelman containing a racial slur, which Boston.com said had been provided to the website by the restaurant owner.

Edelman has reportedly denied sending such an email.

He could not be reached for comment by the Herald last night.

The Boston.com story, which gained significant traction on the Internet, was replaced by an editor’s note that reads: “Earlier tonight, Boston.com published a piece suggesting Harvard Business School Professor Ben Edelman sent an email with racist overtones to Sichuan Garden. We cannot verify that Edelman, in fact, sent the email. We have taken the story down.”","0"
"Justin Bieber Helps Defend Russian Fisherman From Bear","Fisherman Igor Vorozhbitsyn is lucky to be alive - after his Justin Bieber ringtone went off while he was being attacked by a bear.

Igor, 42, thought he was a goner when the brown bear pounced on him as he was walking to a favourite fishing spot in northern Russia's Yakutia Republic.

But as the bear began to claw at him, Igor's mobile went off and the beast turned tail and fled back into the forest.

Wildlife experts believe the ringtone - according to local media the singer's hit 'Baby' - must have startled the bear into halting its attack.

""Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,"" explained one.

Igor suffered from cuts and severe bruises to his face and chest and was rescued when he was found by other fishermen after using the phone to call for help.

Igor - now recovering from his mauling - explained: ""I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I'd marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me.""

"A Justin Bieber Ringtone Just Saved A Man’s Life Who Was Being Attacked By A Bear","Justin Bieber recently saved the life of a 42-year-old Russian man.

No, the Biebs didn’t do anything heroic. When Igor Vorozhbitsyn was en route to his favorite fishing spot in northern Russia’s Yakutia Republic, he was attacked by a huge brown bear.

But then, his cell phone rang and the ringtone, “Baby,” scared off the animal.

As the bear started clawing violently at Vorozhbitsyn, the Biebs’ pre-pubescent vocals made the bear’s ears bleed, and it ran off.

Wildlife experts believe it was the fact that the ringtone sounding off was so unexpected that it spooked the bear, but it’s more fun to say the bear just really, really, hated that song.

Vorozhbitsyn suffers from severe bruises on his chest and face and cuts on his neck. Other fishermen found him after he was attacked, and used his phone to call for help.

Vorozhbitsyn says he knows the ringtone “isn’t to everyone’s taste,” but it was his granddaughter that loaded “Baby” onto his phone “for a joke.”

I think, however, that’s just code for “I’m honestly just a true Belieber.”

Igor Vorozhbitsyn, 42, had parked his car and started walking toward the fishing spot he'd marked out for that day when the bear jumped him from behind.

""There was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me,"" he said, according to the Daily Mail.

The bear mauled Vorozhbitsyn's face and chest, inflicting serious cuts and bruises. He believes it probably would have killed him if his phone hadn't gone off in the nick of time, blaring ""Baby"" loudly enough to drive the bear away.

After narrowly escaping death, he also escaped a lifetime of being known as a Belieber.

""I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,"" the fisherman said.

And then Justin Bieber‘s “Baby” started playing on his phone.

“‘I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” Vorozhbitsyn said, according to the Daily Mail. “‘I know that sort of ringtone isn’t to everyone’s taste.” (Okay, this isn’t the most romantic Russian folk tale.)

According to bear experts, bears are easily scared away by sudden, loud noises, ideally made with air horns, yelling, or, apparently, the tinny screeches emitted by douchebag teenyboppers allegedly “singing.”

Vorozhbitsyn survived after he used his phone to call for help, and has made a full recovery. As to why a burly, 42-year-old Russian man has “Baby” as his ringtone: “My granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke.” Uh huh.

Sighting: A team of Russians believe they have captured footage of the elusive Yeti in a remote patch of woodland

Footage shows a 'bear-like' figure covered in hair emerging from an area of snow-covered trees in the south-western Adygeya Republic before disappearing again seconds later

They said they had questioned residents at a mountainside lodge who claimed to have seen it - and on speaking to others in the area managed to secure reports of several independent sightings.

The group claim they heard the crunching of snow as they headed out to investigate before capturing footage of the creature, which they describe as covered in hair.

Afterwards, they took a plaster cast of a large footprint they said they found in the snow.

Eyewitness Ludmila Hristoforova who spoke to local television said: 'The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we've seen something big and shaggy.'

Homeowner Andrei Kazarian said: 'I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house.

'Although we didn't see anyone we saw its huge footprints. They were five to six centimetres deep and couldn't come from a human foot.

"Bigfoot Strolls Through A Russian Forest -- At Least That's The Claim [VIDEO]","A video has emerged with claims that it shows a large, hairy figure walking swiftly through a snowy, wooded area in Russia. Key details about the incident are missing. But the visuals are remarkable.

Watch it here:

According to Mirror online, some Russian adventurers went in search of the elusive Yeti -- that's what many call Bigfoot in Russia -- after reports of creature sightings emerged from a remote region of the southwestern Adygea Republic in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. The map below shows Adygea's capital city of Maykop.

The research team spoke to local residents who said they saw the unusual animal.

The Daily Mail reports that one eyewitness, Ludmila Hristoforova, told a local television station, ""The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we've seen something big and shaggy.""

Another resident, Andrei Kazaryan (who Mysterious Universe suggests was one of the investigators), said, ""I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house. Although we didn't see anyone, we saw its huge footprints.""

The researchers claimed they captured that video footage -- seen above -- of the hairy Yeti. They also made a plaster cast of a large footprint found in the snow.

Both the video footage and the footprint cast are now reportedly in the hands of local scientists. Oddly, the names have not been revealed of those scientists or of the original researchers who say they took the video.

This story brings up other dubious questions:

Why no exact date or time of the alleged video encounter?

Why is it that, after the ""Yeti"" moves quickly through the snow from right to left, seeming to elude the research group as fast as it can, it suddenly stops its forward motion and casually turns to the right, not appearing to be in a hurry, almost as if it/he was waiting for further cinematic direction from those who were doing the videotaping?

This story is hot on the heels of two other Bigfoot tales we've reported on so far in January, including one that set off a huge controversy about a reported Skunk Ape photographed in Tampa, Florida.

There was also the one about how the Arizona Department of Transportation posted an image on its Facebook page, purporting to show ""a family of Sasquatches"" standing in snow next to a highway on Jan. 1. That turned out to be a little joke played on the public by Arizona state transportation officials.

We have a feeling 2015 hasn't seen the last of Bigfoot.

"Russian Yeti Or Bigfoot Hoax? New Footage Sparks Debate","New footage of the elusive yeti, captured amid the snowfields of Russia, is sparking renewed debate about the creature’s existence, as some see definitive proof while others claim the video is nothing more than a publicity stunt.

A group of Russian researchers set out after the yeti, traveling to the south-western Adygeya Republic after local news detailed sightings of the creature, according to the Daily Mail. The yeti had reportedly been spotted just an hour’s drive away from the city of Adygeisk. After arriving in the area, the team interviewed witnesses at a local mountainside lodge who claimed to have seen the yeti.

Setting out to investigate, the group were stunned to hear crunching snow, before spotting the yeti moving through the trees. As the Mirror reports, they claim to have then captured footage of the yeti, evidence that has since been handed over to local scientists for analysis.

The yeti video has already proven to be controversial, with some observers claiming that the sighting is nothing more than a stunt designed to bring tourists into the Russian town. Others, however, have asserted that the clip represents genuine proof of the yeti’s existence.

Last year, a DNA study conducted by Oxford professor Bryan Sykes failed to identify definitive proof of the yeti from hair samples. As the Inquisitr previously reported, however, Sykes was quick to assert that the study was meant to systematically examine yeti evidence, not pass judgement on its existence.

Hairy human-like beasts have been reported the world over, most famously in the United States, where the creatures are known as Bigfoot (or Sasquatch). In Russia, they are called either Almas or Yeti, names which may denote two distinct species.

CEN   Conclusive proof: A group claim to have spotted the beast in the woods

Eyewitness Ludmila Hristoforova who spoke to local TV station said: ""The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we’ve seen something big and shaggy.""

Another homeowner Andrei Kazarian said: ""I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house. Although we didn't see anyone, we saw its huge footprints.

7 terrifying mystery beasts that never existed

""They were 5 to 6 centimetres deep and couldn't come from a human foot. We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.""

The local team then set off to investigate, and as they headed off into the forest said they were stunned when they heard the crunching of snow, and managed to grab footage of a hairy creature as it emerged from the trees.

After taking a plaster cast of the alleged footprint, the group have now handed their findings to local scientists for analysis.

The footage has already attracted a lot of interest with some suggesting it was just a stunt to bring in tourists, and others convinced that this was the first form of conclusive proof that the yeti exists in the area.

"Bird defecates on Vladimir Putin during speech (video)","Vladimir Putin spoke at the dedication of a new monument to the First World War in Moscow on Friday. The Russian president said that the lessons of the war, which began a century ago this summer, were that peace is fragile, that military aggression is dangerous and that violence can generate more violence in turn.

Putin has supported the separatists in Ukraine who apparently shot down a Malaysian airliner last month, killing all 298 people on board. A bird defecated on Putin during his speech, as shown in the footage above.

European countries have been observing the centenary of the war this weekend, which claimed some 16 million lives, both soldiers and civilians.","0"
"Here's video of a bird pooping on Vladimir Putin in the middle of a speech","Russian President Vladimir Putin was pooped on by a bird while giving a speech unveiling a World War One monument in Moscow on Friday. You can see the freedom bombs land at 0:11 into the above video or you can watch it on repeat, forever, in the gif below.

The Moscow bird poop incident of 2014 is a small but symbolically satisfying comeuppance for Putin's involvement in Ukraine, where fighting with Russia-backed separatists has killed hundreds of Ukrainians and, two weeks ago, 298 civilians flying overhead in Malaysian Airlines flight 17. Europe and the US have punished Russia with economic sanctions meant to deter further aggression, but on Friday this unknown bird launched some targeted sanctions against the man himself.

Rn0eaqx

This being Russia, getting pooped on by a bird wasn't even the most ridiculous part of Putin's WWI speech. Putin warned that the lesson of WWI was — fair warning, irony is going to die forever at the end of this sentence — to avoid excessive ambitions in war. ""Humankind should grasp one truth: violence generates violence,"" said the man whose overt and ongoing support for separatist rebels in Ukraine, which he also invaded to annex Crimea, has helped claim hundreds of lives and stirred up months of crisis.

""It was on the eve of WWI when Russia did everything possible to solve the conflict peacefully, without bloodshed, between Serbia and Austria-Hungary,"" Putin said, repeating an old Russian complaint that only it really wants peace but is ignored by an aggressive West. ""But Russia wasn't heard. And it had to respond to the challenge in order to protect the [fellow] Slavic nation.""

I'm not sure whether Putin means this as an explicit nod to his involvement in Ukraine, but Russia's meddling there has often been internally premised on the idea that Russia must save the Russian-speakers in Ukraine's east. So there would seem to be a parallel. More ironically, the Ukrainians who are fighting and dying to keep Putin out of their country are themselves Slavic, but must have forgotten to thank Putin for his peace-seeking, pan-Slavic magnanimity.","0"
"Terrorist Plot Targeting Black Friday Shoppers Uncovered","The Department of Homeland Security has received serious and credible information indicating that an extremist splinter group of Al Qaeda, now going by the name Bhakkar Fatwa, is planning multiple attacks against American consumers as they wait in line for stores to open on November 28th: the day known as Black Friday.

Bhakkar Fatwa is a small, relatively unknown group of Islamic militants and fanatics that originated in Bhakkar Pakistan as the central leadership of Al Qaeda disintegrated under the pressures of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and drone strikes conducted around the world. The group has since branched out and begun aggressively recruiting throughout the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Within the last year the group has come under increased scrutiny by both the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security as they have begun actively recruiting on American soil.

Jeh Johnson, Director of the Department of Homeland Security, has referred to Bhakkar Fatwa as the number one growing problem on the domestic terrorism front in America. Their presence is felt in many mosques and islamic centers across the country: always quietly and out of sight, and previously without any violent operations. Officials at both the CIA and Homeland Security think that may be about to change.

Jack Phillips, agent in charge of monitoring Bhakkar Fatwa’s American operation detailed the agencies recent findings. “Working with both the CIA and the NSA we were able to access conversations and communications between members of Bhakkar Fatwa’s domestic organization and their leadership in Pakistan which indicate that several attacks are planned against American citizens at retail operations on the 28th of November”, said Phillips. “The instructions sent from Pakistan detailed a broad plan of attacks using both firearms and homemade explosives against large crowds gathered outside of stores waiting for the sales that have become the hallmark of the day. The leadership of Bhakkar Fatwa views the American religion as one worshiping money and possessions. They commanded these attacks as being against the ‘holiest temples’ that the Americans serve.”

“We have taken several actions based off of this information”, stated Phillips. “We have detained three individuals who were in active communication with Pakistani leadership regarding these planned terror attacks. All three are undergoing interrogation as we speak so that we may hopefully determine the scope and extent of attacks that have been planned. The names of those detained will not be immediately released. They have been deemed enemy combatants and releasing their identities could impact our operational ability at this point. Everything conceivable is being done to unmask and deal with this new threat.”

“If you are going out shopping early on Friday please keep your eyes open”, Phillips advised. ” At this juncture we are unsure as to how great the threat from these attacks is going to be. We are working as quickly as we can to resolve this situations, but this terrorist group is savvy. They utilize a small closed cell structure, and we may not be able to identify all of them in time. I urge all Americans to strongly consider whether the sales are worth the risk. And if you do go out take particular caution while waiting in line for the store to open. Intelligence points to the time spent waiting outside of the store as the time of greatest vulnerability. I am sure we will resolve this issue, but I still recommend taking adequate precautions.”","0"
"Accused Boston Marathon Bomber Severely Injured In Prison, May Never Walk Or Talk Again","FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts -

Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was the victim of an “unfortunate accident” yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just weeks after his high-profile trial began, according to warden Paul Jacobson.

Corrections officers reportedly found the alleged terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.

“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”

“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”

“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence,” said warden Jacobson. “Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev were both suspected of perpetrating the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013. The bombings killed three people and reportedly injured as many as 264 others. Shortly after the FBI named the two suspects and released images of them, the two brothers reportedly killed an MIT police officer and carjacked an SUV in a shootout with police. During the shootout, the elder brother, Tamerlan was captured but was killed when his brother drove over him with the SUV. On the evening of April 20, 2013, the wounded Dzhokhar was found unarmed and hiding in a boat on a trailer in Watertown, Massachusetts.

On January 30, 2014, United States Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the federal government would seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev. The trial had just begun on January 5, 2015, as Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him.","0"
"Source: Tom Brokaw Wants Brian Williams Fired","According to the New York Post's Page Six, an NBC source says that Tom Brokaw wants Brian Williams' ""head on a platter"" after the anchor recanted his story about taking incoming fire in Iraq on Wednesday.

""He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report,"" said the source.

The Post reports that Williams' fabrication was long-known at NBC, but at least one employee thinks the Nightly News anchor is unlikely to be punished.

""He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way,"" a network source told the paper. ""He has the full support of NBC News.""

"Tom Brokaw 'wants Brian Williams out': NBC legend 'furious' at Iraq war lie, as it's claimed executives warned anchor to stop exaggerating the story in the past","As a series of ex-soldiers come forward to criticize Brian Williams for his ‘stolen valor’ Iraq war story, it is being reported that top level executives at NBC News had known the tale was fake and had been begging the newscaster for years to stop repeating it.

Williams is at a center of a media firestorm after he was found out for embellishing an old war story about being in a helicopter hit by a grenade during the Iraq war in 2003.

The newscaster acted swiftly on Wednesday night to attempt to diffuse the situation by apologizing during his Nightly News show, but since then a series of ex-soldiers have come forward to criticize Williams ‘half-hearted’ apology.

Brian Williams is at the center of a media firestorm over his embellished war story and now it transpires that NBC News executives - and Tom Brokaw - had known for years that the story was false

To make matters worse there are also now reports that senior executives at NBC News, including legendary anchor Tom Brokaw who Williams replaced in 2004, knew the story was false.

‘Tom Brokaw and [former NBC News President] Steve Capus knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it,’ an insider told the New York Post.

Now Brokaw, 74, has had it and wants Williams fired, the Post claims.

Senior executives had in the past asked Williams to stop telling the story in public, reports Variety.

Despite his credibility being called into question, Williams still took the anchor’s seat for his Nightly News broadcast on Thursday evening but unlike on Wednesday he didn't address the issue during the broadcast.

'Brokaw wants Williams’ head on a platter. He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report,' said the source.

Retraction: NBC anchor Brian Williams has been forced to admit that he wasn't aboard a helicopter hit and forced down by enemy fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as he claimed in a broadcast on Friday, pictured

However a separate source says that isn't going to happen. 'He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News,' said the source.

On Thursday the pilot of the army chinook that was attacked by rocket-propelled grenades told the Omaha World-Herald that he had contacted NBC News not long after their initial broadcast. Don Helus said he saw Williams’ initial report not long after its original broadcast after someone emailed him a clip.

NBC’s Tom Brokaw introduced the report with the words: 'Our colleague Brian Williams is back in Kuwait City tonight after a close call in the skies over Iraq.'

Helus said he contacted Williams’ producer and asked for a retraction, but didn't get a reply.

'My crew was a little upset about that - somebody trying to make a claim to inflate their career,' Helus said.

Williams was forced to apologize on air and on Facebook on Wednesday and admit that he wasn't aboard a helicopter that was hit, but had been traveling in a separate aircraft more than half an hour behind that landed without incident.

'He was actually on my aircraft and we came in behind [the other helicopter] about 30-45 minutes later,' Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Miller, the flight engineer on the helicopter that carried the journalists, wrote on Facebook after NBC shared a link to Williams' story.

Williams pictured in Iraq in 2003 with Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack: In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday, Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the 'fog of memory over 12 years' for his error

'He had the audacity to tell me the whole thing was like 'Saving Private Ryan' and that the whole army would be out looking for him. I called him an idiot in front of his camera crew and he didn't come back to my bird for the next three days.'

Pate Butler, another soldier, confirmed on Facebook: 'He flew with the Savannah birds in a totally different flight. Never was shot at. That aircraft was out of Germany and we were all in that flight.'

Lance Reynolds, another soldier who had actually been on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit, also lashed out at Williams on Facebook.

'Sorry dude, I don't remember you being on my aircraft,' he wrote. 'I do remember you walking up about an hour after we had landed to ask me what had happened.

'Then I remember you guys taking back off in a different flight of Chinooks from another unit and heading to Kuwait to report your 'war story' to the Nightly News.

'The whole time we were still stuck in Iraq trying to repair the aircraft and pulling our own Security.'

Speaking to Stars and Stripes, Reynolds recalled how he had been aboard the helicopter when it was hit by two rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire.

The damaged Chinook made a rolling landing at an Iraqi airfield, skidded off the runway and came to a stop in the desert. Reynolds and other crew members were unhurt.

Called out: Lance Reynolds, left, and Pate Butler, right, who were both part of the crews flying that day, said that Williams had not been aboard their damaged helicopter and expressed their anger at his lies

Anger: The day after Williams' report, Reynolds responded to the story on NBC NIghtly News' Facebook and said that he remembered things rather differently

Another man, Joseph Miller, who claimed to be on Williams' aircraft at the time said he had been 'calling him out on this for a long time with no response'

'It was something personal for us that was kind of life-changing for me,' he told Stars and Stripes.

'I know how lucky I was to survive it. It felt like a personal experience that someone else wanted to participate in and didn't deserve to participate in.'

When Williams approached him and took photos of the damaged aircraft, Reynolds said he dismissed the level of danger because he didn't want his wife to see a news report about it.

'I wanted to tell her myself everything was all right before she got news of this happening,' he said.

Another man on the downed aircraft, Mike O'Keeffe, said he had long been bothered by Williams' false claims.

'Over the years it faded,' he said, 'and then to see it last week it was - I can't believe he is still telling this false narrative.'

O'Keeffe added that he was satisfied with Williams' apology and didn't want to push the issue any further or 'kick the guy when he is down'.

Other soldiers have accused Williams of being misleading in his apology and continuing to imply details that are false.

Denial: Williams denied that he was 'trying to steal anyone's valor' in a message he posted on Wednesday

Since the 2003 incident, Williams' Chinook story has been recounted countless times and gradually the reporter's role seems to have grown.

NBC reported the incident on March 26, 2003, with the headline, 'Target Iraq: Helicopter NBC's Brian Williams Was Riding In Comes Under Fire.'

However when the incident was reported the next day by the New York Daily News it stated that a 'chopper was hit and forced to land. Then the one carrying Williams landed.'

Three days later USA Today carried a similar report that stated: 'NBC's Brian Williams was stranded in the Iraqi desert for three days after a Chinook helicopter ahead of his was attacked by a man who fired a rocket-propelled grenade.

'The grenade just missed, but it forced the group to make an emergency landing. Luckily, a U.S. tank platoon was there and surrounded the helicopters, killing four Iraqis.'

In a 2007 entry from his blog Williams recounts how he was part of a 'flotilla of four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters'.

'Some men on the ground fired an RPG through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours.

'There was small arms fire. … All four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor,' he recalled.

By the next year Williams was claiming on his blog that 'all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire.'

'The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor, as all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire,' he wrote.

'We were forced down and stayed down -- for the better (or worse) part of 3 days and 2 nights.'

The tale takes a more dramatic twist during a 2013 appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman. By now Williams is recalling that two helicopter were hit - including his.

'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one I was in,' he told Letterman.

Then during his report on January 30, Williams once again told an inaccurate version of events so that now 'the helicopter we were travelling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.'

For example, army flight crews told Stars and Stripes that Williams implied he was flying with the same company that the downed helicopter belonged to - but he was actually flying with a different company in a different direction, and only linked to the unit by radio.

He also suggested that his aircraft was forced to land because of the attack, but soldiers said it was landed due to deteriorating weather conditions.

After Williams' apology, there were cries for him to be terminated.

'Brian Williams has to go,' Brent Bozell, the founder and president of the Media Research Center, wrote on Twitter. 'NBC's credibility is completely shot.'

The Nightly News anchor has often repeated the war story over the past 12 years about how the aircraft he was on was forced down by enemy fire.

He repeated his old war story on Friday when he presented a segment about a public tribute at a hockey game in New York for Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack, a retired soldier who had provided security for the grounded helicopters.

During the report, Williams went further and said that the aircraft he was on had actually been hit - and the soldiers expressed their anger on Facebook afterwards.

'I would not have chosen to make this mistake,' Williams told Stars and Stripes. 'I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.'

On the Nightly News broadcast on Wednesday evening, Williams told viewers that his mistake was a 'bungled attempt' to honor a soldier who had helped protect him.

'I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago. I want to apologize,' he said.

In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the 'fog of memory over 12 years' for his error.

'I feel terrible about making this mistake, especially since I found my OWN WRITING about the incident from back in '08, and I was indeed on the Chinook behind the bird that took the RPG in the tail housing just above the ramp,' he wrote.

'Because I have no desire to fictionalize my experience (we all saw it happened the first time) and no need to dramatize events as they actually happened, I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area - and the fog of memory over 12 years - made me conflate the two, and I apologize.'

Williams went on to strenuously deny that he was 'trying to steal anyone's valor'.

'I was and remain a civilian journalist covering the stories of those who volunteered for duty. This was simply an attempt to thank Tim, our military and Veterans everywhere -- those who have served while I did not.'

All the credit: After his apology, Twitter users joked about Williams inserting himself in other historic events

One of the top trending topics on Twitter on Wednesday night was #BrianWilliamsMisremembers.

'#BrianWilliamsMisremembers and then I said look Woodward you and Bernstein are in way over your head,time to follow a real man..lets do this,' tweeted one person.

'And I just knew we could make a better portable music player. Called it the iPod.' #BrianWilliamsMisremembers,' wrote another.

Williams appeared nonplussed about the scandal on Wednesday evening as he enjoyed a New York Rangers game with his good friend Tom Hanks

The two shared plenty of laughs and thrills at the game only hours after Williams apologized for his 'mistake'

Williams has anchored NBC Nightly News - the nation's highest rated news program - since December 2004 when he replaced Tom Brokaw.

His reporting from inside the New Orleans Superdome in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina the next year helped earn NBC a Peabody Award.

"Tom Brokaw Wants Brian Williams Fired Over Iraq Helicopter Story: Report","Famed NBC journalist Tom Brokaw thinks that Nightly News anchor Brian Williams should be fired, according to a report from the New York Post's Page Six, which cited NBC insiders. Brokaw's ire was prompted by Williams' admission that a story he has often repeated about being in a helicopter, which was shot down during the 2003 Iraq war, was untrue.

“Brokaw wants Williams’ head on a platter,” the source told the paper. “He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report.”

The source also said that both Brokaw and former NBC News President Steve Capus were aware that the story was untrue ""for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it.""

Williams had repeatedly claimed that he had been traveling on a U.S. military helicopter that was downed by RPG fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, most recently on a Jan. 30 broadcast. He also told the story during an appearance on David Letterman's show.

NBC shared a clip of Williams recounting the story on Facebook, “Sorry dude, I don't remember you being on my aircraft. I do remember you walking up about an hour after we had landed to ask me what had happened,” Lance Reynolds, the flight engineer for the helicopter that was struck, wrote in response, prompting Williams' on-air apology Thursday.

Speculation has been rife about whether Williams will, or should, lose his job or face some kind of sanction for the misrepresentation. Williams argued that it did not represent dishonesty, saying rather that he “made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago.”

Thus far, NBC News has made no official statement about the incident, and has announced no investigations or possible disciplinary measures, suggesting that the company is supporting the anchor, and hopes to ride out the wave of criticism he is currently attracting, the Washington Post reported.

“You could say it’s business as usual,” an anonymous NBC executive told the paper. “He has the whole support of NBC.”

In addition to the apparent support of NBC, Williams also has the support of his esteemed colleague Dan Rather, who defended Williams Thursday.

""I don't know the particulars about that day in Iraq. I do know Brian,"" Rather said in a statement provided to The Huffington Post. ""He's a longtime friend and we have been in a number of war zones and on the same battlefields, competing but together. Brian is an honest, decent man, an excellent reporter and anchor -- and a brave one. I can attest that -- like his predecessor Tom Brokaw -- he is a superb pro, and a gutsy one.""","0"

"DNA Results Confirm Michael Jackson Is Biological Father Of Bruno Mars","NEW YORK, New York -

Vladimir Kershov, publicist of R&B singer Bruno Mars, has been fired today after he revealed a shocking secret regarding the pop and R&B singer. Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars’ biological father.

In a statement emailed to news and media outlets across the world, Kershov revealed that he was told by the singer that DNA testing had proven that Jackson, known across the world as the King of Pop, was without a doubt his biological father. After pleading with Mars, born under the name Peter Hernandez, to go public with the revelation, Mars refused to do so. Kershov insisted that it be made known to the public, and that the news would catapult the singer’s fame and boost record sales. Mars remained adamant that the information not be released. According to Kershov, he then took it upon himself and emailed the shocking news to media sources all over the world.

“DNA testing has proven that Michael Jackson is the biological father of Bruno Mars,” Kershov said in the statement. “Against his wishes, I have decided to relay this message for the greater good and betterment of Bruno’s life and extravagant music career.”

In a statement released by Mars’ new publicist, Jacqueline Pryor, it has been announced that Kershov was immediately fired by the singer, and may seek legal action against his former publicist. “The job of a publicist is indeed to better the career of their clients by persuading them to take part in things that cause their popularity to grow, however, the client must trust their publicist. The artist has the final say, no matter what.”

When asked about the validity of Kershov’s statement, Pryor surprisingly made it clear that the information is accurate. “It is true. Doesn’t mean he was right in saying so, but it is true. When it comes to 29-year-old Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson is the father!”","0"

The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport is the world’s most expensive production car and is capable of going from 0 to 60mph in just 2.6 seconds.

But its flashy owner will be reeling, as the graffiti is set to slash a whopping half a million pounds off the racing car's retail value.

The image was posted on Reddit this week, with some users condemning the graffiti artists for vandalism and other suggesting it was the handiwork of a jilted lover.

One Twitter user even suggested it could be a sign of activism by the culprit.

"Chinese State Media Warns People To Stop Calling Themselves Dumbledore","This week CCTV News, the state-run broadcaster, came up with these tips for any Chinese people considering an English name – one of which is to steer clear of “Dumbledore”.
This week CCTV News, the state-run broadcaster, came up with these tips for any Chinese people considering an English name &ndash; one of which is to steer clear of ""Dumbledore"".
Warner Bros. Entertainment
It’s common for Chinese people to choose an English name, partly to make conversation with non-Chinese speakers easier. Many Chinese students in western colleges go by an English name, for example.
But as CCTV points out, some people are choosing names that might sound odd to English speakers.
The article says: “While native English speakers are stuck with whatever happy or unhappy names they’ve been given, Chinese and other ‘non-natives’ get the lucky choice of picking their own English name.
“However these choices can mean more than you think!”
Religious, mythical, and fictional characters such as Vampire, Satan, Medusa, and Edward Cullen are a no-no.

“Unique names like these aren’t just very amusing to English speakers, it also suggests you have some connection to that name,” the article warns.
“So if you call yourself Satan, you might get a few foreigners thinking you’re anti-Christian, or possibly a member of a heavy metal band.”
CCTV says Harry is OK, if you’re a Harry Potter fan, but only because it was a common name to start with.
Also on the “no” list are common everyday words that aren’t used as names in English, such as Lawyer.

Other examples include Surprise, Dragon, and Fish – things that might be related to the characters in someone’s Chinese name.
“Sure, have fun and pick a random object or word as a name, but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America.” CCTV says.
CCTV closes the article with this advice for anyone thinking of an English name:

A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms. They’re full of name stereotypes – you’ll find the good girls’ are all ‘Janes’, the jock boys are still ‘Buds’ and the geeks are called ‘Sheldon’.","0"

"Chinese advised to choose British-sounding names to get ahead","Chinese people have been given state advice on the adoption of English sounding names – being urged to avoid those that make them sound like a “stripper” and instead opt for ones that imply the bearer is from “a fancy or conservative family”.

A report published on the website of CCTV, a state broadcaster, offered readers practical advice on the selection of their Western-style name, a rite of passage for most young Chinese.

“Take heed,” the article said. “English names come with different connotations…A name can come with a 'feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are.”

Names “with a distinct feeling of Britishness” such as Elizabeth, William and Catherine were considered as “safe” by the article, which was illustrated with a picture of the Royal family.

But other, less desirable name types were also listed, such as those derived from “suggestive” foods such as Candy, Lolly and Sugar which were “typically thought of as 'non-smart girl’ names, or 'stripper’ names.”

Picking the distinctive name of a world leader of celebrity such as Obama or Madonna, or that of a religious figure (“Satan”), was not advised.

In a discussion about the article on Observer, a news portal, one user suggested that the tradition could be short-lived. “Why get an English name?” Xiao Weixia wrote. “Just wait, everyone will get a Chinese name in the future.”","0"
"The Chinese Guide to Avoiding a Bad English Name","Years ago, I had a job in China where I evaluated the spoken English of college students. One bright young woman introduced herself to me with her Chinese name. Then she added: ""You can call me 'Easy.' That's my English name.""

I paused, thought for a moment, and then decided to say something. ""You might want to consider changing your name,"" I said, explaining—as delicately as possible—that ""easy"" was an unfortunate name for a woman. Mortified, she thanked me for the tip. ""I'm going to go and change my name now,"" she said.

People in China have adopted English names for decades. Many choose ones that resemble their birth names: Chinese boys named ""Da Wei,"" a common name, almost invariably become ""David."" Others find inspiration from singers, athletes, politicians, or movie stars. In my first year in China, I taught five different boys called ""Tom Hanks,"" thanks in part to Castaway's success.

Most of the ""English"" names I encountered were conventional, though others—like the aforementioned ""Easy""—were less than appropriate. (I also taught a boy named ""Fish"" who, perhaps inspired by a certain musical artist, preferred to render his name by drawing it.)

Sweets-inspired names are ""typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.""
CCTV, China's state-run broadcaster, wants to solve this problem. In an article published by its English-language channel, the network laid out a series of guidelines for how not to name yourself. For example, avoid naming yourself after a food item (""Candy""), a famous person (""Obama""), or a very old person (""Gertrude""). If you name yourself ""Satan,"" says CCTV, people might think you're anti-Christian, or worse, a ""member of a heavy metal band."" Proper and traditional names, like ""Michael,"" ""William,"" and ""Elizabeth,"" on the other hand, imply you're from a fancy and conservative family. Sweets-inspired names are ""typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.""

One wonders if certain American celebrities might not also benefit from these guidelines. For instance, here's what CCTV has to say about using food as a name:

""Food is very hit or miss. And usually miss. One of the issues here is that food names can be 'very' suggestive.""

That's from a Comcast customer, who says it's a transcript of a conversation s/he had with a Comcast rep after noticing that Tor, an online privacy- and anonymity-enhancing tool loathed by the NSA, was blocked on her/his Internet connection.

Comcast Declares War on Tor? [Nathan Wold/Deep Dot Web] (Thanks, Alan!)","0"
"Comcast Declares War on Tor?","If you needed another reason to hate Comcast, the most hated company in America, they’ve just given it to you: they’ve declared war on Tor Browser.
Reports have surfaced (Via /r/darknetmarkets and another one submitted to us) that Comcast agents have contacted customers using Tor and instructed them to stop using the browser or risk termination of service. A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an “illegal service.” The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies.
The Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer.
The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor. The Comcast agent then allegedly told the customer:
Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate,   fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.
How did Comcast know its customers were using Tor in the first place? Because Tor Browser provides online anonymity to its users,  This would mean that Comcast is monitoring the online activities of its users, to (among other things) check if they are following their Acceptable Use Policy.
Comcast has previously been listed by the Tor project as a Bad ISP. The users of the Tor project listed Comcast as a bad ISP that is not friendly to Tor. The Tor project cited Comcast’s Acceptable Use Policy for its residential customers which claims to not allow servers or proxies under “technical restrictions.”:
use or run dedicated, stand-alone equipment or servers from the Premises that provide network content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local area network (“PremisesLAN”), also commonly referred to as public services or servers. Examples of prohibited equipment and servers include, but are not limited to, email, web hosting, file sharing, and proxy services and servers;
A Comcast spokesperson told DeepDotWeb that:
We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customer’s account with a valid court order. And if we’re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.
However, this statement appears to be at odds with Comcast’s treatment of Ross Ulbricht, alleged Dread Pirate Roberts.
Comcast previously corroborated with the FBI by providing information on alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht’s internet usage. Ulbricht’s legal defense without a warrant. Ulbricht was most certainly never given a warning by Comcast or given time to contact a lawyer before he was arrested in a San Francisco library last October.
Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the “Six Strikes” plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are emailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity. Comcast will continue monitoring them, and if they violate the “Six Strikes” plan five more times, their internet service will be terminated.

"Crabzilla! Photo appears to show giant CRAB measuring at least 50ft across lurking in the waters off Whitstable","The seaside town might be famed for its oysters, but this incredible image could soon have visitors flocking to Whistable in the hope of catching Britain's biggest crab.

The photograph, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

While some insist it is proof of 'Crabzilla', others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank - or is simply a playful hoax.

Crabzilla: The photograph, above, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft wide lurking in the shallow water. It dwarfs the fishing boasts resting on the nearby pier

The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour - dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier.

It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches.

The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable - an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

Its curator, Quinton Winter, said that at first he thought the image - sent to him by a follower - showed an unusual sand formation, but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep.

Speaking to the Daily Express, he claimed that he saw the giant creature close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer.

He said: 'At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ""that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood"".

Hoax? It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water but normally grows to no more than 10 inches. Some claim that the incredible image is simply a playful hoax

The aerial image reveals the outline of a crab at the mouth of Kent harbor, yet the size of the animal dwarfs fishing boats on a nearby pier, as the Daily Mail notes. The giant animal is shaped like an edible crab, a species commonly found in British waters, but which only grows to be ten inches across, on average.

Quinton Winter, who curates Weird Whitstable, asserted that the image of the giant crab was sent to him by a follower. At first, he believed that it showed only an unusually shaped sand formation, though he is now convinced that there truly is a strange animal lurking in the harbor.

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood,’ Winter said. “It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws… Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

In July of last year, another image emerged, depicting a giant crab lurking underneath a pier.

Another image, said to be taken in July of last year and posted on Winter’s Weird Whitstablog, purports to show a giant, albeit smaller, crab hiding under a pier.

“This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend,” claims Winter’s website, adding “The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passersby shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water, into the dark, sideways.”

Graphic artist Ashley Austen noted his skepticism of the aerial image while speaking to Kent Online, describing the way in which such a photograph could be easily manufactured.

“The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop,” he said. “All the ‘artist’ had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbor and apply a few filters to it to get the realistic look.”

The photograph of the monster crab first came out in the website Weird Whitstable, which collects exciting and unusual pictures of sightings reported in the town of Whitstable, Kent.

Quinton Winter, the curator of the website, reveals that a follower sent him the picture of the giant crab lurking at the Kent harbor. The satellite image of the crab shows the creature to be about 50 feet in size, more than four times bigger than the biggest crabs alive on the planet. Winter initially thought the crab-like image was due to some sort of sand formation; however, he now believes that it is an actual crab.

Winter says that he may have also seen the gigantic crab when he went for crabbing with his son in the summer of 2013.

""At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'that's a funny looking bit of driftwood,"" said Winter.

Japanese spider crabs, found in the waters around Japan, are the biggest known living crab species is the world. The Japanese spider crab can weigh up to 12 kilograms (26.45 pounds) and its leg span can reach up to 3.8 meters (about 12 feet).

Even though some people believe that the giant crab image is real, there are some who believe it is a hoax and may be the result of computer image manipulation. The image could be an enlarged picture of an edible crab with the scientific name of Cancer pagurus, which is generally found in the waters surrounding the British Isles. However, this crab species is not as big as 50 feet but measures just about 10 inches and weighs just around six pounds.

But Seidel’s back was facing the camera and it appeared to many viewers he was answering Mother Nature’s call instead of reporting on it. But the network said he had dropped his phone in the snow and was looking for it.

The TV news weather forecast appeared to call for yellow snow — but the network says it was not so.

NBC weatherman Mike Seidel missed a live report from snow-blanketed North Carolina on Saturday night because his back was to the camera. And the way he turned around while also on camera — appearing to zip up the fly of his pants before putting his gloves back on — suggested to viewers that he had been relieving himself.

During the telecast anchor Lester Holt said hello to the No. 1 Weather Channel meteorologist who was in Sugar Mountain, but his back was turned to the camera.

Seidel's body was slightly hunched over and he was looking downward near some trees.

After a few pauses Seidel can be heard asking ""Why?"" as he starts to turn around. The weather man is holding his gloves in his hands despite the cold temperature.

As he turns he slightly moves his arm, which may have been an attempt to close an open zipper. He then hurriedly puts his gloves back on.

A network official told the Daily News that Seidel had dropped his cell phone in the snow and had turned around to find it.

Seidel has tweeted pictures of the snowstorm on his Twitter account, but did not make any mention of the incident.

Sgt Monning's son, Logan Monning, told CBS that his father had woken up with 'stomach issues' and had gone to the clinic as a precaution.

Logan said their family was told by the CDC that their father was not at risk of the virus, as he had only been in the apartment for 30 minutes and had not come in contact with bodily fluids.

A father who had taken his teenage son to the clinic to get a flu shot on Wednesday told WFAA that the man entered the clinic with his wife, appeared flushed and was hunched over.

Chuck Moreno said that he and his son had self-quarantined in an exam room, put on surgical masks and sprayed themselves with disinfectant.

Sgt Monning answered yes in a screening questionnaire to a question about travel to West Africa and is said to have contact with Duncan, referred to as ‘patient zero’.

The Frisco patient was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hosptial by ambulance after turning up at the urgent care clinic on Main Street.

Medics at the clinic called 911 at around 12.30pm to request an ambulance for the patient. A team in hazmat suits and face masks transported the law enforcement officer.

A hospital spokesman said: 'Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas can confirm today that a patient has been admitted to the Emergency Room after reporting possible exposure to the Ebola virus.

'Right now, there are more questions than answers about this case. Our professional staff of nurses and doctors is prepared to examine the patient, discuss any findings with appropriate agencies and officials.

Sgt Michael Monnig went on Wednesday to an urgent-care facility in Frisco, Texas with his wife, after complaining of stomach problems.

The deputy presented at the clinic a week after he visited the Dallas home where Duncan was staying when he developed Ebola symptoms. Sgt Monnig was at the home to deliver a quarantine order to family members.

Neither Sgt Monnig, nor the other two health officials, Zachary Thompson and Christopher Perkins with him, were wearing protective clothing or masks despite being in the apartment as cleaning crews were going about their work in full protective gear.

The day after going into the apartment, Monnig and his fellow officers were told to bag up the clothes they'd been wearing. Their police cars were also taken out of commission.

'That starts putting question marks in your mind,' Monnig told WFAA in an October 3 report. 'You know when you go home and then the next day you start hearing that equipment is being quarantined or asked to be bagged up, that you had on or were driving.

'Then your question is, ""well, what about me?"" And so those were the questions that were raised.'

Now the question is: Why wasn't Monnig warned before entering the home completely without protection?

'There should be some kind of protocols as far as what kind of a response we're going to have and what kind of safety equipment we're going to have,' Dyer said in the WFAA interview. 'Those kinds of things didn't happen.'

Mr Duncan, 42, died on Wednesday morning at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, two weeks after developing symptoms of the virus.

Sgt Monnig told medics at the Frisco clinic today that he had been in contact with first victim Mr Duncan and had not been wearing protective clothing.

The CareNow clinic was immediately placed in lock-down because Monnig was exhibiting signs of the deadly virus - including feeling sick and appearing flushed with a fever.

Neither Sgt Monnig, nor the other two health officials, Zachary Thompson and Christopher Perkins with him, were wearing protective clothing or masks despite being in the apartment as cleaning crews were going about their work in full protective gear.

'It was pretty scary': Monnig's wife recalled the fear she had after learning her husband was in the apartment where Duncan took ill and likely relived that fear Wednesday

The day after going into the apartment, Monnig and his fellow officers were told to bag up the clothes they'd been wearing. Their police cars were also taken out of commission.

'That starts putting question marks in your mind,' Monnig told WFAA in an October 3 report. 'You know when you go home and then the next day you start hearing that equipment is being quarantined or asked to be bagged up, that you had on or were driving.

'Then your question is, ""well, what about me?"" And so those were the questions that were raised.'

Now the question is: Why wasn't Monnig warned before entering the home completely without protection?

'There should be some kind of protocols as far as what kind of a response we're going to have and what kind of safety equipment we're going to have,' Christopher Dyer, president of the Dallas County Sheriff's Association, said in the WFAA interview. 'Those kinds of things didn't happen.'

Monnig's wife Lisa echoed his sentiment.

'It was pretty scary,' Lisa Monnig said about the day her husband entered the apartment. 'I was awake until he got home that night.'

No doubt Monnig is now feeling that pit in her stomach again as she and her family are forced to wait out the next two days it will take to determine whether Monnig managed to catch the dreaded virus.

Mr Duncan, 42, died on Wednesday morning at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, two weeks after developing symptoms of the virus.

Sgt Monnig told medics at the Frisco clinic today that he had been in contact with first victim Mr Duncan and had not been wearing protective clothing.

An ambulance, driven by a firefighter-paramedic wearing a hazmat suit, carries an individual, believed to be a Dallas County sheriff's deputy, with Ebola symptoms to a hospital in Frisco, Texas on Wednesday afternoon after the person turned up at an urgent care clinic

The CareNow clinic was immediately placed in lock-down because Monnig was exhibiting signs of the deadly virus - including feeling sick and appearing flushed with a fever.

The CDC told MailOnline today that the person is not one of the 48 contacts being monitored, and there is no indication of any direct contact with the initial patient, Mr Duncan.

None of the 48 individuals with verified or possible contact with the patient has shown symptoms, the CDC said today.

Sgt Monnig's son, Logan Monnig, told CBS that his father had woken up with 'stomach issues' and had gone to the clinic as a precaution.

Logan said family were told by the CDC that their father was not at risk of the virus, as he had only been in the apartment for 30 minutes and had not come in contact with bodily fluids.

'We are not expecting him to' test positive for Ebola, said Logan.

A father who had taken his teenage son to the clinic to get a flu shot on Wednesday told WFAA that the man entered the clinic with his wife, appeared flushed and was hunched over.

Chuck Moreno said that he and his son had self-quarantined in an exam room, put on surgical masks and sprayed themselves with disinfectant.

Sgt Monnig answered yes in a screening questionnaire to a question about travel to West Africa and is said to have contact with Duncan, referred to as ‘patient zero’.

The Frisco patient was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hosptial by ambulance after turning up at the urgent care clinic on Main Street.

Medics at the clinic called 911 at around 12.30pm to request an ambulance for the patient. A team in hazmat suits and face masks transported the law enforcement officer.

A hospital spokesman said: 'Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas can confirm today that a patient has been admitted to the Emergency Room after reporting possible exposure to the Ebola virus.

'Right now, there are more questions than answers about this case. Our professional staff of nurses and doctors is prepared to examine the patient, discuss any findings with appropriate agencies and officials.

The two other men are seen here leaving the apartment where Patient Zero stayed while ill. Neither Thompson nor Perkins have reported any worrisome symptoms

'We are on alert with precautions and systems in place. At the same time, we are caring for routine cases which are completely separate in operations.'

The clinic was keeping everyone at the center until they are checked out by the CDC - it is unknown how many people were exposed to the patient.

All those at the clinic will be transferred to a hospital but it is unclear which medical facility.

While no doubt in a fearful and nearvous state now, Mr. Monnig's career has often hinged largely on his physical toughness, even more so than most cops.

The large-framed Monnig once worked as a sort of human punching bag for incoming Dallas County police recruits who learned how to use batons by beating Monnig.

At least that was his job until 2008, when Monnig was temporarily terminated from the police force after getting seriously injured during one of his brutal training sessions.

He was unable to work in active duty and the force was apparently not interested in giving him a desk job.

'Your job is basically to get beaten up by recruits,' CBS DFW said in a 2008 interview about his firing.

'Part of it is,' he replied. 'I want it to be as realistic as possible.'

Thanks in part to the 2008 broadcast, Monnig was rehired by the force.

Mr Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian national, exposed nearly 50 people to the disease in America before he was put in isolation at Texas Presbyterian.

His fiancee Louise Troh is currently in quarantine with her 13-year-old son and two nephews and under constant monitoring by health officials over fears that they, too, could develop symptoms during a 21-day incubation period.

Tough guy: Part of Monnig's job, at least back before 2008, was to take the physical blows dealt by Dallas county police recruits learning how to use batons

Fired: After sustaining an injury during his extreme training sessions that kept him off his beat, Monnig was fired. However, a local CBS report that cast light on the apparent unfair treatment got Monnig his job back

Ten people, including seven healthcare workers and three family members, are considered at high risk for Ebola after they were exposed to Duncan after he became contagious.

Another 38 more are being monitors by the CDC for possible risk of the disease.

Duncan's fiancee Louise Troh, who is perhaps highest at risk of catching the disease after she cared for him at her Dallas apartment while he sweated and vomited through the early staged of the disease, says she does not blame him for possibly exposing her.

The White House said on Wednesday that extra screening for fever will be carried out for arriving aircraft passengers from West Africa, where the virus has killed nearly 4,000 people in three countries.

The screening will start at New York's John F. Kennedy airport from the weekend, and later at Newark Liberty, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta.

Authorities will use a non-invasive device to take the temperature of passengers and have them fill out a questionnaire created by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) asking for detailed information about their activities.

Paramedics are reportedly transporting the patient, who has not yet been identified, to Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, the Morning News reported. Staff and patrons of the facility are being examined for the deadly virus.

Since Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola, there have been 5,000 false alarms in the U.S., Forbes wrote Wednesday. The Centers for Disease Controls said it received more than 800 calls a day regarding the deadly disease -- a drastic jump from the 50 calls a day it received before Duncan’s infection was known.

Duncan, the first person in the U.S. to become sick with virus, died Wednesday. “It is with profound sadness and heartfelt disappointment that we must inform you of the death of Thomas Eric Duncan,” said a statement from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where he was being treated. “He fought courageously in this battle.”

More than 3,400 people in West Africa have been killed by the latest outbreak. The virus might have been spread through handling “bushmeat,” which is the meat of African wild animals, and contact with infected bats.

It has been verified that Jack Phillips returned from Dallas last week while on business. Shortly after arriving home, Mr. Phillips began exhibiting flu-like symptoms, but did not immediately go to the hospital. At this time his wife and children began showing similar symptoms, which provoked the family to get tested.

"Ghost Ship Filled with Ebola-Ridden Rats Heading for Florida","The ship left Sierra Leone on July 13 2014 in destination of the Mexican city of Tampico. Six days after leaving the port of Freetown, the captain of the ship reported in a radio communication that three of the crew members were beginning to show distressing symptoms that suggested they could be infected with ebola, and that the ship was changing course to head towards Cape Verde to get some medical help. This was the last time that the crew was heard of, and all 17 men on board are presumed to have died in only a few days later.

The ship could now pose an important threat to the American public, as the ship is believed to be infested with thousands of starving rats possibly carrying the ebola virus. Many of the witnesses who came across the ship over the last months, have indeed reported seeing the rodents feeding off the crew’s bodies as the ship went by. Experts fear that these animals could now spread the disease to humans and other animals on the continent, creating an uncontrolable ebola pandemic in the United States.

The ship is believed to be infested with thousands of ebola-ridden rats, fear local health authorities

The Guinean Luck has been reported multiple times in the Atlantic Ocean, drifting away slowly along the North Equatorial Current towards the American continent. It has been sighted almost a dozen times since November 2014, by various ships sailing north of the Antilles. It was last reported to have been seen by fishermen, only a few nautical miles North of the territorial waters of Bahamas.

Despite their efforts, the American authorities have not been able to locate the ghost ship, but some recent satellite pictures showing the ship have enabled them to narrow the search area to approximately 400 square nautical miles (nearly 1375 km² or 530 square mile). A total of 324 coast guard ships and 32 helicopters have already been affected to the search operations, forming the largest search force ever created by the U.S. coast guard.

Ships and officers of the U.S. Coast Guard from the entire East Coast have been mobilized in a desperate attempt to find and sink the ship before it reaches America.

Experts and analysts estimate that the ship’s actual course and speed will bring it to land or be washed ashore in Southern Florida over the next weeks, probably near the densely populated Miami area. The authorities remain confident however, that the ship will be found and sunk before it reaches the coast.","0"
"University Bans Word ‘Freshman’ Because It’s Sexist and Promotes Rape","Elon University in North Carolina banned the word “freshman” from its website and student orientation, claiming it’s sexist and suggests that the young women might make good rape victims.

It’s replacing the term with “first-year.”

“The term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time,” Leigh-Anne Royster, the school’s “Inclusive Community Wellbeing Director” told the College Fix.

“Given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses, it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way,” she added.

In fact, the word is apparently so dangerous that any orientation leader who dared to use it was immediately corrected.

“They engrained over and over in our brains that it was supposed to be ‘first-year,’ not ‘freshman,’” sophomore orientation leader Alaina Schukraft told the Fix. “They were very adamant . . . and stressed the importance of using language that would make the new students feel comfortable.” 

Ironically, Schukraft said that multiple students approached her and said they were actually more comfortable with the word “freshman.”

But no matter. Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, insists that it will make the school a better place for women — telling the Fix that people consider “freshman” to be a “sexist” word.

“As an inclusive community, Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body,” Zaiser said in an e-mail to the Fix.

No public announcement was made about the word switch. According to the Fix, administrators relied “largely on word of mouth.”

"UNIVERSITY DROPS TERM ‘FRESHMAN,’ REPLACES IT WITH ‘FIRST-YEAR’","OFFICIAL: Celebrates wider range of identities and expressions, protects young women from sexual violence

ELON, N.C. – Elon University has dropped the term “freshman” from its vocabulary and replaced it with “first-year,” a move made official this fall and implemented in everything from its website to orientation workshops.

The change at the small, private liberal arts college in North Carolina was done to promote inclusivity, celebrate diversity, and ensure the campus did not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students, campus officials said in interviews with The College Fix.

Leigh-Anne Royster, director of Elon’s “Inclusive Community Wellbeing,” said in an email to The College Fix that she has been told by some that they believe the term “freshman” is outdated, and that replacing “freshman” with “first year” is a “celebration of diversity.”

Royster stated the word “freshman” naturally insinuates a hierarchy among students on campus. She said she believes that students are viewed as younger and less experienced when referred to as “freshman.” With that, Royster stated “freshman” may contribute to sexual violence on campus because it labels the youngest students, causing them to be targets.

“The term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time,” Royster said. “Given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses, it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way.”

Royster said she believes this change will positively impact future students at Elon and foster progress in inclusivity related to gender.

“Using language that allows for a more inclusive understanding of gender will be important in our culture moving forward,” she said. “Moving away from language, including pronouns, that denote a gender binary will be something we see more and more as our culture evolves to celebrate a wider range of identities and expressions.”

At this semester’s student orientation leader training, administrators made it clear that incoming students must be called “first-years.” No public announcement was made regarding this change — administrators relied largely on word of mouth to carry the news.

Elon sophomore Alaina Schukraft, an orientation leader, told The Fix that each time an orientation leader said “freshman” in training, he or she was immediately corrected.

“They engrained over and over in our brains that it was supposed to be ‘first-year,’ not ‘freshman,’” Schukraft said. “They were very adamant about using the correct terminology and stressed the importance of using language that would make the new students feel comfortable.”

But when the new wording was rolled out, not all incoming students were comfortable with this change. Schukraft said multiple incoming students approached her saying they were more comfortable with the term “freshman.”

But Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, said in an email to The College Fix that the change improves the campus environment.

Zaiser said administrators believe the change keeps with Elon’s core values, and is a more appropriate description for new students. He added some believe “freshmen” is a “sexist” term, and Elon is attempting to move away from gendered stereotypes.

“As an inclusive community, Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body,” Zaiser said in an email to The College Fix. “ ‘Freshman’ isn’t necessarily wrong, but it’s not completely applicable to Elon’s entire population, which includes internationals, transfers, spring admits, along with traditional students beginning their first year on a college campus.”

College Fix contributor Diana Stancy is a student at Elon University and president of the Network of enlightened Women (NeW) chapter at Elon.

"ESPN's Domestic Violence Panel Is Missing Something Important","Actual women.

With ongoing outrage over the NFL's recent slew of scandals, it made perfect sense when ESPN announced it will hold a panel on domestic violence Monday night. But as the two organizations geared up this discussion about women and abuse in the world of sports, it quickly became painfully clear that women had been completely excluded from the table. 

As Esquire's Ben Collins pointed out last week, the panel will consist entirely of male commentators, while female reporters will be literally sidelined in the discussion.

""Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24,"" Collins wrote.

"Fidel Castro Rumors Sweep Internet, but No Sign in Cuba","Social media around the world have been flooded with rumors of Fidel Castro's death, but there was no sign Friday that the reports were true, even if the 88-year-old former Cuban leader has not been seen in public for months.

Similar speculation has swept across Cuban expatriate communities repeatedly over the decades, particularly after a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother Raul.

The new wave was prompted in part by Fidel Castro's failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on Dec. 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago.

The chatter appeared to pick up when some media noted Thursday that Castro had not been seen in public in a year. He last appeared on Jan. 8, 2014, at an art exhibition in Havana, ending nine months out of public view.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July. Castro was last heard from on Oct. 18, when he published an editorial about Ebola.

By Friday, Cuba-related Twitter accounts were ablaze with speculation, fueled in large part by reports on news websites such as Diario de Cuba and Diario las Americas that Cuba had scheduled a news conference, possibly to discuss Castro's health.

The rumors were further stoked when respected Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on its website that Castro had died. It quickly pulled the report back, however.

Cuban officials told news media in Havana that no press conference had been called, and there were no obvious signs of official preparations for mourning.","0"
"Fidel Castro Is Dead, According to Viral Twitter Rumors","No one has died more times than Fidel Castro.
But yesterday, rumors began flying anew in the Cuban-American community -- and, of course, on Twitter -- that the Cuban leader has finally bitten the dust and that a possible news conference will announce his demise today. Could the speculation finally be true this time?

The reports began circulating late yesterday around Twitter:


So far there's nothing substantiating all the buzz. Cuban media outlets have denied any news conference is scheduled, and the hype also comes ""suspiciously close"" to the actual death of Fidel Castro Odinga, the 41-year-old son of a Kenya opposition leader, as the Daily Mail reports.

There is another reason the rumors may be swirling: According to Fox News Latino, yesterday marked one year since the 88-year-old revolutionary was last seen in public.

Let's hope Fidel himself jumps on Twitter soon to deny -- or confirm? -- the rumors.","0"
"WATCH: Twitter catches fire amid rumors of Fidel Castro’s death","Fidel Castro was pronounced dead on Twitter sometime around 3:59 p.m. on Thursday. It was an unconfirmed rumor, of course, but it was announced confidently so many folks assumed it was true — or at least worthy of retweet.

Then separate rumors started about Raul Castro calling a press conference at 9 a.m. or 11 a.m. today, allegedly to announce his brother’s death.


As South America’s Twittersphere caught fire, some started questioning whether the users in their feed were even talking about the right Fidel Castro. After all, Al Jazeera reported on Jan. 4 that the  Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of Kenya’s main opposition leader, died in Nairobi last weekend after a night of drinking with friends. Could it be that Twitter users were confusing the dead Kenyan man with his Cuban namesake?


Twitter heatmap shows mention of “Fidel Castro” from 10 a.m. Thursday- 8 a.m today (GMT).

An overly excited Wikipedian edited the entry for Cuba’s Fidel Castro to say “this article is about a person who has recently died.” Moments later, the Castro’s Wikipedia entry was reverted back and to his undead version.

By 8 p.m., media outlets around Latin America were reporting “strong rumors” about Castro’s death and the alleged forthcoming announcement by Cuban officials.


But on the island, where folks are more accustomed to rumors of Castro’s death, the situation seemed less urgent. Journalists in Havana said they were aware of the rumors, but weren’t finding echo on the streets of Cuba. It’s true Castro hasn’t been seen in public in a year, but rumors of his death — as Mark Twain might have said — appeared to be greatly exaggerated.

"#RIPFidel fuels false rumors of Cuban leader's death after another Fidel Castro dies","Rumors of the death of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who has not been spotted in months, went into overdrive on Friday night due in part to an unrelated death thousands of miles away.

As the #RIPFidel hashtag began to spread online, it became clear that rumors of Castro's death were being fueled by the high-profile death of a different man with the same name, half a world away.

Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of prominent Kenyan politician and former prime minister Raila Odinga, reportedly died on Jan. 4. His Cuban namesake, however, still appears to be very much alive.

Reports of Fidel Castro's death have been a staple of the international rumor mill for years, with speculation on the former Cuban leader's status bubbling up every few months.

There is no indication that the 88-year-old Castro is on his deathbed. However, he last appeared in public on Jan. 8, 2014 at an art exhibition in Havana, ending nine months out of public view.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21, 2014. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July. Castro was last heard from on Oct. 18, when he published an editorial about Ebola.

In 2006, a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president, and hand over leadership to his younger brother Raul Castro.

"FIDEL CASTRO DEATH WATCH: RUMORS HEAT UP, CUBA DENIES","Cuban dissidents and Cuban-American media are reporting that Havana is plagued with the most serious rumors in months that former dictator Fidel Castro has died, after the one-year anniversary of Castro’s last public appearance transpired without fanfare on Thursday.

The rumors began to circulate almost immediately after President Barack Obama announced that the United States would yield major concessions to the Cuban government in exchange for the freedom of USAID worker Alan Gross, jailed for attempts to bring Internet services to Jewish Cubans. As Fox News Latino reports, Fidel Castro made no public comments on the matter, triggering a wave of rumors in Cuban dissident media. Castro has previously commented on a number of current events, including blaming the United States and the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, of creating the Islamic State terrorist group in September.

One dissident blogger in particular, Yusnaby Pérez, exacerbated rumors by writing about them in a Spanish-language post titled “Has Fidel Died?“, in which he detailed changes in behavior from neighborhood communists who had previously been loud and fervent in their displays of support for the Castros, particularly on January 1, the anniversary of the Revolution:

This January 1st, my neighbor Mercy did not hang her “VIVA LA REVOLUCIÓN” sign, as usual, at the entrance to her house. How strange! It is the first year since I can remember that neither Fidel nor my neighbor’s odious sign–with Soviet font–appears.

Pérez tweeted that, almost immediately after publishing the blog post, the Cuban government shut down his entire page, at least within Cuba. His Twitter account appeared unscathed, however, where he posted images of Cubans wearing American flag leggings after the announcement of President Obama’s concessions to the Castros.

Rumors strengthened this week, however, as the anniversary of Castro’s last appearance approached. News outlets in Miami, the de facto capital of the Cuban diaspora, reported this week that the Cuban government had called for a press conference today to follow up Castro’s year-long absence with an update, many speculating that they would announce Castro’s death. The Cuban Foreign Ministry denied that any such press conference was scheduled for today, however, or that they had any major news to break. Instead, they noted that there was no record of an email or text message sent out to convene reporters, as is customary.

But dissidents continue to report strange incidents that give fuel to the rumor that, if not dead, Castro is close to death. Miami media professor Carlos Peñalosa reported that rumors had not been abated by the Cuban government message, and that “[Venezuelan President Nicolás] Maduro must be on his way to Havana”:


Yusnaby Pérez also reports that there are “strong” rumors that Raúl Castro called the socialist Venezuelan president urgently to Havana, another alleged sign that Castro has died:


Maduro had traveled to China to ask the Chinese government for financial aid, as the Venezuelan economy is collapsing under his socialist price controls and suffering due to the extremely low international prices of crude oil. And despite the rumors, Venezuelan state media reported that he landed in Iran today, with no apparent emergencies to attend to on the Western Hemisphere. Nonetheless, Venezuelan opposition media are reporting that his departure from China was indicative enough of a route back to Cuba.

While there are no concrete answers to whether the Cuban government is hiding either the impending or already occurring death of the leader of the communist revolution, the Daily Mail has a theory: that Cuban dissident media has confused the former dictator with Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician who died this week.","0"
"Hundreds mourn the 'death' of Fidel Castro after rumours sweep Twitter (but are they confusing him with recently departed Fidel Castro Odinga from Nairobi?)","Twitter is abuzz with rumours that Cuba's former communist leader Fidel Castro has died, although the timing is suspiciously close to the death of another high-profile person who shares his name.

While reports of the death of Cuba's 88-year-old former leader could be true, there has been no official confirmation and his death has been mistakenly claimed on social media many times in the past.

Also casting doubt on today's rumours is the possibility it has been confused with the recent death of the son of Nairobi's opposition leader, named Fidel Castro Odinga, 41, who died only days ago.

However, speculation is rife that the former leader of Cuba has died after Venezuelan media reports the Cuban Government has called for a press conference with the international media today. Venezuela and Cuba have fostered a close relationship for decades.

The report in the Diario de Cuba, didn't specify a time or subject for the press conference, saying that the Cuban government's press office wouldn't give out the information..

It has also been claimed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has rushed to Havana, adding some substance to the rumours that Castro's death could be announced.

Castro, who passed on Cuba's leadership to his brother Raul in 2008, was announced Prime Minister of Cuba after overthrowing the government in 1959 and under his rule turned it into a one-party state.

Cuba's Fidel Castro (pictured left in 1976 and right in 1978) ushered in a long period of communism to the tiny island in what developed into a highly antagonistic relationship with the U.S.

He has lived in increasing seclusion from the outside world ever since he retired from the leadership amid speculation that his health was suffering.

It is understood he was recently being cared for by his wife and by a team of nurses. Once an enthusiastic food connoisseur, he has long since stopped visiting Havana restaurants.

Today his former Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Perez Silva told various outlets: 'Fidel is waiting for the right moment, because he is a great prophet who knows the right moment to say what needs to be said.'","0"
"Rumors Of Fidel Castro's Death Circulate After Prolonged Absence From Public Life","Once again rumors of the death of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro have spread across the exile community and across social media.

El Diario de las Américas, a Florida-based publication read mostly by Cuban exiles, reported Thursday that the Cuban government had called a press conference amid speculation about Castro’s health. The Cuban government later disputed the report, saying no such press event had been planned, according to AFP’s correspondent in Havana.

The Cuban government’s lack of transparency and the lack of an independent mass media on the island have long provided fertile ground for rumor’s of 88-year-old Castro’s death since he fell ill in 2006.

Since the reports on Thursday Twitter has been abuzz with rumors of his death, though they have not yet been confirmed.

As Univision news anchor Jorge Ramos warned, this is not the first time Fidel Castro’s alleged death has taken over the internet. In 2012 rumors of his death began circulating after news that Venezuelan doctor, Jose Rafael Marquina, said the former leader had suffered cardiac arrest and was in a vegetative state.

“Careful. Remember that here in Miami, almost like a ritual, Fidel Castro is killed several times a year” Ramos wrote on Twitter.

Thursday marked one year since Castro’s last public appearance, according to Fox News Latino. His absence at major events like the 56th anniversary this week of Castro’s entry into Havana after the victory of the Cuban Revolution or the return last month of three Cubans convicted of spying in the U.S. have led some to believe that his health has worsened. Castro has yet to comment on the historic resumption of diplomatic relations with the United States for the first time since 1961, announced by both governments last month. The most recent ""Reflection,"" as Fidel Castro's columns are called, appeared in October 2014.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was the last head of state to meet with Castro in August 2014 and published photos of their meeting. Maduro stated that he found Castro had an “impressive lucidity, an impressive train of thought and exceptional wisdom.”

Adding to the confusion, Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga’s son, Fidel Castro Odinga, was found dead in his home in Nairobi on Jan. 4.

"Rumors about Fidel Castro’s death again circulate on the Internet","MEXICO CITY — Rumors about the death of Fidel Castro — an age-old ritual for Cuba-watchers — once again began circulating on and off the island this week.

It’s true that Castro hasn't been seen in public in about a year, and it’s been a few months since one of his last columns were published. Castro, 88, has not said one public word about the historic announcement by President Obama last month about his goal of moving toward normal relations with Cuba after a half-century Cold War stand-off.

Twitter went wild Thursday night with speculation about his demise. Why? There are rumors about that, too. One of them is that another Fidel Castro, this one the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, died a few days ago (Fidel Castro Odinga of Nairobi), and maybe this was all a social media mash-up of mistaken identity.

Also, an Argentine Web site reported that foreign press in Havana had been summoned to a news conference — presumably to announce the huge news — but this turned out to be false. On the island, there was more talk this morning that Fidel’s brother, current President Raul Castro, would be speaking today at noon, but that came and went in silence.

Instead, Cuban state media has been promoting a round-table interview with the three members of the “Cuban 5” who were released from U.S. custody as part of the prisoner swap.

The Cuban government hasn’t spoken one way or the other about Fidel Castro’s health in recent days.","0"

Apple's mid-range smartwatch will likely start at $500Apple's mid-range smartwatch will likely start at $500

Assuming the sources are correct, that pegs the anodized aluminum Apple Watch Sport as the lower-priced $349 model.

The anonymous sources, speaking with the French site iGen (English translation), also said Apple will ship its smartwatch in time for Valentine's Day in February. While a February release would be nice because it would get Apple Watch on consumer's wrists earlier, doesn't fit with Apple Senior Vice President of Retail Angela Ahrendts comments saying the smartwatch will ship in Spring 2015.

Apple Watch is a smartwatch device with sensors for tracking fitness activities and heart rate. It links to your iPhone to display alerts and messages, lets you reply to messages, shows turn-by-turn directions, learns your fitness routine and offers suggestions for improvement, and more. Three models in two sizes with multiple band options will be available when Apple Watch ships.

Hopefully Apple will release Apple Watch earlier in the year instead of some time in Spring, because even though products like Microsoft's new Band and Fitbit's just announced Surge aren't direct competitors, they are enticing enough to draw away some sales. Waiting until Spring could cost Apple some momentum, too.

iGen has been accurate in the past with Apple information, so they may be right on the pricing, but we're going with Angela Ahrendts on the release time frame because she's clearly in a good position to know when her own company's products will ship.","0"
"Bin Laden Shooter Rob O’Neill Mistakenly Attacked By Street Thugs Seeking To Collect Debt From Neighbor","BUTTE, Montana -

Robert O’Neill, the former United States Navy SEAL who shot and killed Osama Bin Laden, had his home mistakenly invaded by members of a street gang this morning shortly after 1AM. O’Neill was uninjured, the five intruders all suffered injuries and remain hospitalized, but are expected to make a full recovery. Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm.

Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of O’Neill’s.

“Mr. O’Neill had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. O’Neill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. O’Neill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!” commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled.

O’Neill had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist Kevin Williamson interviewed the celebrated war hero.

“It was nothing really. Those kids didn’t have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb,” O’Neill stated.

The neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police. According to the men in custody, the debt was over a $50 bag of marijuana.","0"
"Missing Nuke In Colorado Sparks Intense Russian Fears","The Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is reporting today that President Putin’s order to begin deploying tactical nuclear weapons throughout the Crimean Federal District is “intensely/directly related” to a “missing”, and believed stolen, low-yield atomic cannon shell from its storage bunker in Fort Carson, Colorado, which is a United States Army installation located near the city of Colorado Springs.

According to the SVR, the atomic weapon missing from Fort Carson has been identified as a W48 nuclear artillery shell that measures 155 mm (6.1 inches) in diameter and 845.82 mm (33.3 inches) long.

This report notes that the W48 was produced in two models, Mod 0 and Mod 1, which weighed 53.5 and 58 kg (118 and 128 pounds) respectively and have an explosive yield equivalent to 0.072 kiloton (72 tons of TNT).

Though the US had reported that all of their W48 nuclear shells had been “retired” by 1992, this report says, the SVR has long noted their continued “use for training” by US Army 4th Infantry Division forces headquarter at Fort Carson and under the command of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) forces operating from the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker complex, all of whom are located in El Paso County, Colorado.

The specific US weapons platform designed to fire the W48, this report notes, is the Paladin M109A6 155mm Artillery System [3rd photo left] which is currently operated by  forces belonging to the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division.

Over the past few days when this W48 nuclear shell “disappeared”, this report continues, the forces of the 1st Brigade Combat Team were involved in training exercises with the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armored Regiment at Fort Carson ahead of their planned deployment in the next few weeks to the Fort Irwin National Training Center, in California, which will span much of November, after which they will be prepared to deploy to combat worldwide.

US media reports about this missing W48 nuclear shell are “nonexistent”, this report further notes, other than their noting that Fort Carson has been put on a “total lockdown” as US military forces there continue their search for what they call a lost ""sensitive item"", a term they use that refers to gear including weapons, ammunition and night vision goggles - items that cause high-level concern when missing.

These media reports further report that whatever is missing, it must be small enough to fit in a car causing Fort Carson security officers to spend about two hours inspecting all vehicles leaving Fort Carson's gates yesterday and their spokesman stating: “As part of random searches at the gate, we are conducting outbound vehicle searches in order to prevent the unauthorized removal of government property from the installation.”

Of critical concern to the Kremlin regarding this missing W48 nuclear shell, SVR intelligence analysts in this report state, is that if fits nearly exactly to the strange and mysterious war game sprung on world leaders this past March by President Barack Obama that he named “nukes on the loose” and involved a terrorist attack with an atomic “dirty bomb” that takes place in the financial heart of an unnamed but Western metropolis.

London’s Telegraph News Service in their report on this “nukes on the loose” war game further noted:

“David Cameron joined Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and Xi Jinping and other world leaders to play a ""nukes on the loose"" war game to see how they would cope with a terrorist nuclear attack.  The German chancellor grumbled at being asked to play games and take tests with the Prime Minister, US and Chinese presidents around a table with dozens of heads of state at a nuclear summit in The Hague. Her complaints were overruled because Mr Obama was keen on the idea and in on the surprise.”

Of equal concern to the Kremlin, this report continues, are that these events are occurring as predicted by former US Assistant Treasury Secretary Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who this past June warned that Obama regime was planning for a preemptive nuclear attack.

In his warning Dr. Roberts stated: “Washington not only has war plans for launching a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia, and also possibly China, but Washington has a cadre of people who advocate nuclear war. We have people running around Washington saying things such as ‘What’s the good of nuclear weapons if you can’t use them.”

With the “suicidal tendencies” of the Obama regime becoming more apparent by the day, the SVR in this report grimly concludes, Russia’s near record de-Dollarization efforts, when coupled with the “secret deal” between the US and Saudi Arabia to destroy Syria, point towards a truly tragic global outcome as the American-backed Western economy is near collapse…and all who oppose them will surely suffer their wrath….including the 1.2 million of their own citizens they currently have under surveillance and targeted for destruction.

"Saudi Arabia's national airline planning to introduce gender segregation on flights","After a number of complaints from passengers about ""random males"" being seated next to their wives, Saudi Arabia's national airline is looking in to segregating their flights. 

Saudi Arabia's national airline, Saudia, will order its staff to keep men and women seated separately on flights from now on after passengers complained about the lack of segregation on their flights.

The Emirates247 news website reported that the airline, which already complies with many of the religious practices of Islam including not offering alcohol or dishes that contain pork on their flights, have decided to separate men and women on board, unless they are close relatives. 


Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, Saudia's assistant manager for marketing, said that ""there are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers"". According to RT.com, Saudia is not the first airline to encounter these issues after Israeli carrier El Al faced delays to a flight back in October as Orthodox Jews refused to be seated next to women on the plane, while Delta have also faced a similar issue, both occurring on flights between Tel Aviv and New York.","0"
"Saudi Arabia May Be Taking Misogyny to the Skies","The calendar may have just flipped to 2015, but Saudi Arabia is partying like it's 1755. 

The Daily Mail reports that Saudia, the kingdom's national airline, will introduce gender-segregated flights. Except close relatives, men and women flying on Saudia can reportedly look forward to assigned seating based on their naughty bits.

The discriminatory practice stems from multiple complaints lodged by male fliers who were unhappy that other men were allowed to sit next to their wives and female family members. Some men also objected to the conduct of a female flight attendant, which they deemed too ""flirty.""

The change was first reported by Gulf media outlets, according to the Daily Mail. ""There are solutions to this problem,"" Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd told Ajel, a Saudi Arabian newspaper. ""We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.""

The airline will apparently include orders for flight-booking staff on the ground to make sure men and women are separated, Emirates247 reports. According to Mashable, however, a marketing manager for the airline is denying their plans to segregate passengers.

Saudia already follows a variety of religious practices onboard, including the prohibition of alcohol and pork dishes and reading a Quran verse before takeoff. The airline also chooses not to hire Saudi women to work as cabin crew.

Similar complaints have been heard on flights traveling to Israel. In September, a flight headed to Tel Aviv from New York was delayed because several ultra-Orthodox Jewish men wouldn't sit next to women who weren't family members; more recently, a Delta flight was delayed for half an hour because ultra-Orthodox men refused to be seated next to women, and other passengers wouldn't change seats with them.

One Chicago woman started a petition on Change.org to stop the practice of forcing women to change seats, arguing that ""one person's religious rights do not trump another person's civil rights.""

She's right, and the same could be said of discriminatory rules like those that Saudia reportedly plans to introduce. But given its already troubled history of the treatment of women — it was ranked the third-worst country in the Arab world for women — these new guidelines unfortunately appear to be more of the same. 

Mic has reached out to Saudia for comment but received a message indicating that the company's inbox was full. We'll update if we hear back.","0"

Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, “There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.” The airline will supposedly begin having airport staff assign separate seating for men and women, unless they are closely related.

It’s not only Muslims that are concerned over seating assignments, but also Orthodox Jews. An El Al Airlines flight in September from New York to Israel was delayed because some men refused to be seated next to women…

"Saudi national airline may introduce gender segregation on its flights","Saudi Arabia’s national airline carrier is planning to introduce gender segregation aboard its flights following complaints from passengers who refused to have random males seated next to their wives, the Kingdom’s media report.

Airline company Saudia will order its staff to keep men and women separated onboard, unless they are close relatives, the Emirates247 news website reported.

“There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,” Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, according to Saudi daily Ajel.


Saudia's traveling policies are already in accord with the strict Islam practices of Saudi Arabia. For instance, in addition to the routine boarding announcements at the Kingdom’s airports, a prayer or verse from the Quran is read prior to take off. Furthermore, international flights usually have a specially designated men’s prayer area to accommodate 5 daily prayers. In addition, the airline does not offer any beverages or dishes which contain alcohol or pork products. And the onboard entertainment menu does not offer any movies with adult content.


The Kingdom itself is infamous for gender segregation in everyday matters of society. For instance, women typically require male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home. Saudi women are also not employed as stewardesses on Saudi Arabia’s national carrier. That role is reserved for women of other nationalities.

Ironically enough, Israel too is battling the same problem, as many ultra-orthodox Jews refuse to share their transit time with female companions. A flight from New York to Tel Aviv was delayed by half an hour in late December after a group of male Jewish passengers onboard a Delta flight refused to sit next to women.


In October, on the eve of the Jewish festival Rosh Hashana, ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) men left the plane before take-off, also between New York and Tel Aviv, again refusing to sit next to women. In an incident in September, Israeli carrier El Al flight was postponed by 11-hours after a group of Haredi passengers refused to sit next to women.

Last September an Israeli campaign, seeking to put a stop to the segregation stalemate started an online campaign on Change.org, entitled, ""Ultra-Orthodox passengers refuse to sit next to women on El Al flights""

""Why does El Al Airlines permit female passengers to be bullied, harassed, and intimidated into switching seats which they rightfully paid for and were assigned to by El Al Airlines? One person's religious rights does not trump another person's civil rights,"" the petition said.","0"
"Saudi airline, Saudia, to ban gender-mixing","Saudi Arabia’s national carrier Saudia intends to ban gender-mixing aboard all its flights in line with rules enforced by the conservative Gulf kingdom.

The airlines said it decided to act following recurrent complaints from passengers objecting to have males seated next to their wives and other female family members.

“There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,” Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, quoted by the Saudi Arabic language daily ‘Ajel’.

He did not elaborate, but the paper said it would include instructions to flight booking staff at the Gulf kingdom’s airports to ensure males and females are separated aboard Saudia’s flights unless they are closely related.","0"
"Saudi Arabia airline segregation: Saudi airlines to assign seats based on gender","Saudi Arabia airlines has a new passenger plan: Segregation. The Arab state’s national airlines plans to introduce the gender segregation, proving just how far behind the western Asian nation is when it comes to human rights. Complaints were reportedly received by the airlines of men sitting next to their spouses. In Saudi Arabia, one of the very few countries that have rejected adoption of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it’s customary for a female to walk a few feet behind her male counterpart.

Writes RT.com on Jan. 2: “Airline company Saudia will order its staff to keep men and women separated onboard, unless they are close relatives, the Emirates247 news website reported. ‘There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,’ Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, according to Saudi daily Ajel.”

The proposed rule from the Gulf kingdom is in line with strict interpretations of Islamic practices. The complaints were allegedly aired by single, Saudi men who saw other married men sitting directly next to their spouses or female strangers. The airlines has issued an updated set of regulations “to flight booking staff at Gulf airports to keep these new rules in place,” writes the Daily Mail.

The carrier already has number of Islamic guidelines in place – the airline does not offer alcohol (or pork dishes), a prayer from the Quran is uttered before the flight leaves the tarmac, and some flights have an area on the plane designated as a “male prayer zone.” The airlines also will not hire any women from Saudi Arabia – they are employed from surrounding countries only.

The Daily Mail picks up the story: The country is known for its gender segregation, with women requiring a male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home. In public spaces such as restaurants, beaches, amusement parks or banks, women are required to enter and exit through special doors. Women who are seen socializing with a man who is not a relative can even be charged with committing adultery, fornication or prostitution.

UK’s ""The Week,"" in September, published an article entitled Eleven things women in Saudi Arabia can't do. While not the case in all parts of the country, the article says women are unable to walk without a male chaperone, vote, swim, drive, or try on clothes in a store, among other restrictions.","0"
"Gill Rosenberg, Canadian citizen, reportedly captured by ISIS in Syria","The federal government is working to confirm reports that Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian citizen, has been captured by Islamist extremists in Syria.

According to the Jerusalem Post, websites ""known to be close"" to ISIS extremists reported the capture of the Israeli-Canadian woman, who joined Kurdish fighters overseas, on Sunday.

""Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels"" to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities, a spokesman for the foreign ministry said on Sunday.

The newspaper said the websites give few details on the alleged capture, only that it occurred after three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters were holed up.

Clashes between ISIS and Kurdish troops have largely focused on the Syrian city of Kobani, near the Turkish border.

The now-notorious al-Qaeda splinter group is currently in control of large swaths of territory in both Syria and Iraq.

Messages of concern were posted Sunday on a Facebook profile belonging to a Gill Rosenberg. An earlier message asked for advice on joining the Kurdish army.","0"
"Unconfirmed reports claim Canadian-Israeli Gill Rosenberg captured by ISIS","A Canadian-Israeli woman who has joined the ranks of the Kurdish militias fighting Islamic State in northern Syria has been taken captive by ISIS fighters, blogs and Islamist websites thought to be close to the militant group reported.

A blog considered to be one of the Islamic State's media arms reported that several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been captured, among them Gill Rosenberg. According to the report, prior to their capture Islamic State fighters made three suicide bombing attacks against Kurdish outposts, killing some and capturing many others.

According to Israel Radio, Kurdish sources denied the reports, saying Rosenberg wasn't in the area when it was attacked.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, a resident of Tel Aviv, joined the Kurdish troops against Islamic State in northern Syria earlier this month. According to reports, Rosenberg said she had contacted Kurdish fighters over the Internet before traveling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

According to Walla, Rosenberg immigrated to Israel from Canada in 2006, leaving behind a career as a civilian pilot, and served for two years in the Israel Defense Forces. In 2009, she was extradited to the United States and jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said.

Israel Radio aired an interview with Rosenberg earlier in November in which she said she had travelled to Iraq, was training with Kurdish guerrillas and would fight in neighbouring Syria.

""They are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really,"" she told Israel Radio, explaining her decision to enter the combat zone in northern Syria.

A source in the Kurdistan region said Rosenberg, known in Israel by her Hebraised first name Gila, was the first foreign woman to join Syrian Kurds in battle, in addition to several Western men who are fighting in their ranks.

""After me""

A Facebook page registered to Rosenberg showed photographs of her in settings marked as Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria.

""In the IDF (Israeli army), we say 'aharai', After Me. Let's show ISIS (Islamic State) what that means,"" read a Nov. 9 post.

Rosenberg had consented to extradition and served around three years in a U.S. prison under a plea bargain, her lawyer said. A 2009 FBI statement on the case names her as Gillian Rosenberg, among 11 people arrested in Israel ""in a phony 'lottery prize' scheme that targeted victims, mostly elderly"".

Israel's NRG news site reported at the time that Rosenberg turned to crime after running short on money, that she was estranged from her parents and had tried in vain to join the Mossad spy service.

""She is incredibly strong, both in mind and in body,"" said long-time friend Daniel Lieber in Massachusetts. ""She has always been someone interested in politics and is very pro-Israel.""

Discreet ties

Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with the Kurds since the 1960s, seeing in the minority ethnic group a buffer against shared Arab adversaries. The Kurds are spread through Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran.

Worried about spillover from the Syrian war, Israel has been cracking down on members of its 20-percent Arab minority who return after volunteering to fight with Islamic State or other rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad's rule.

Israel bans its citizens from travelןng to enemy states, among them Syria and Iraq, and officials did not respond to a Reuters inquiry about whether the woman could face prosecution if she returns to Israel.

"ISIS Claims It Kidnapped Gill Rosenberg, The First Western Woman To Fall Into The Group's Hands","A 31-year-old Canadian-Israeli woman who traveled to Iraq to join the Kurdish fight against the Islamic State group reportedly has been abducted by ISIS. Gill Rosenberg, 31, a former Israeli soldier, was captured after three suicide bombings near Kobani, the Times of Israel reported.

The SITE Intelligence Group said jihadists are discussing ideas for executing her or using her for a prisoner exchange. The capture was reported Sunday on the Islamic State-associated blog Samoach al-Islam and other Islamist websites. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said it is investigating the claim, which was not backed by any evidence, the Jerusalem Post said. The Israeli security service Shin Bet told the Post it had “no further details” about the reported abduction.

The Canadian government said it is looking into the report, according to CTV News. The Department of Foreign Affairs told the media outlet in an email it was “pursuing all appropriate channels” in seeking to determine Rosenberg's whereabouts, but declined to release any other information.

Quoting two Kurdish fighters, Israel Radio reported Rosenberg was not near Kobani.

The Post noted if the claim is true, it would make Rosenberg, who was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and moved to Israel in 2006, the first Western female to fall into the Islamic State group’s hands and her Israeli citizenship could complicate the situation even further. Steven Sotloff, who was executed by ISIS in August, had dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship.","0"
"'No hard evidence' of Isis claims it kidnapped Canadian-Israeli woman Gill Rosenberg","Gill Rosenberg is reported to have been captured with several other women fighting with Kurds

There is “no hard evidence” that Isis has captured a Canadian-Israeli woman fighting with the Kurds in Syria, an expert has said, as officials struggle to discover the truth of militants’ claims the woman is just one of a group of female fighters to have been kidnapped near Kobani.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, is a Canadian-born woman and resident of Tel Aviv who volunteered to fight alongside Kurdish fighters in Syria.

According to a blog linked to Isis (also known as Islamic State), which has been quoted by Israeli media reports, Ms Rosenberg was captured alongside several female fighters near Kobani. These reports have not yet been confirmed by Israeli officials, and the Canadian foreign ministry has said it is “pursuing all appropriate channels” to confirm Ms Rosenberg’s whereabouts.

“I cannot confirm that and I hope that it isn’t true,” Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Ya’alon told an Israeli television channel when asked about the reports.

Charlie Winter, a researcher at counter-extremism think tank Quilliam, said that while the rumours swirl around the state of Ms Rosenberg’s capture, there is “no hard evidence” to show that she has been taken by Isis.

“No photos of her have been circulated by Isis,” Mr Winter said, “which means there is no hard evidence that she has actually been captured. At the same time, the YPG have denied the rumours, and the Free Syrian Army’s representatives in Kobani said the rumours haven’t been confirmed to them either.”

Mr Winter said despite the lack of physical evidence, the YPG and the Free Syrian Army are “not above deliberate obfuscation to make Isis look weaker,” but that it is impossible to know the truth without any official pictures or statements.

Others have refuted rumours of Ms Rosenberg’s kidnap however, claiming that she simply has no internet access and will be updating her status on Facebook as soon as she had a connection.

Oliver Brimo, who appears to be a friend of Ms Rosenberg, posted on her Facebook profile on Monday: “To those who are concerned about Gill Rosenberg’s safety. Gill is safe and she is not active on Facebook cause she has no internet access. Once she has internet access she will be updating her status [sic].”

He added: “Isis’s supporters launched a rumour on social media that she was captured in #Kobani which is not true, simply because Gill is at least 300km from Kobani [sic].”

Mr Brimo told The Independent on Monday that his source claims to have seen Ms Rosenberg ""in person hours ago"".

On 20 November, Ms Rosenberg posted that her Facebook page and friend requests were to be managed by someone else until she had access again, which she expected to happen approximately two weeks later, around the second week of December.

Messages of concern have flooded her Facebook page since the claims emerged of her kidnapping.

Ms Rosenberg is a former member of the Israel Defence Force. A source linked to the YPG, the Kurds’ dominant fighting force in northern Syria, told Reuters News Agency in November that Ms Rosenberg was their first female foreign recruit and had crossed into Syria to fight Isis.

"Gill Rosenberg, former IDF soldier, possibly captured by ISIS while fighting with Kurds","Canadian national and former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier Gill Rosenberg, 31, revealed to the Israeli media earlier this month that she had traveled to Iraq to help the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) fight off ISIS.
""They are our brothers,"" she told Israel Radio of the Kurds. ""They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really.""
Now, just three weeks later, there are rumors she may be in ISIS custody. Posts on ISIS-affiliated web forums, including Al Platform Media, claim the ""Zionist soldier"" was captured while fighting with the Kurds against ISIS in Kobane, a small majority-Kurdish town along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
There has indeed been intense fighting in Kobane between ISIS and the YPG over the past 24 hours. However, YPG sources have strongly denied to the Journal and other outlets that Rosenberg was captured.
So far, neither group has provided evidence either way, and ISIS has yet to release an official statement.

A spokesperson at the IDF news desk told the Journal that the IDF is not keeping track of Rosenberg, and ""does not have a way of knowing"" if she's been captured by ISIS. Minister of Defense Moshe Ya'alon, too, told Channel 2 that he had no information on Rosenberg's whereabouts.
Rosenberg, formerly a resident of Tel Aviv, did post to Facebook on Nov. 20 that she would be taking a short leave from social media.
""My Facebook account and friend requests are being managed by someone else until I have access again in apx 2 weeks time on or around week of 12/8,"" she wrote. ""Please do not message as this is not me. Thank you.""
A couple weeks before that, right around her 31st birthday, Rosenberg posted photos of herself on the Iraqi-Syrian border, and wrote: ""In the IDF, we say אחריי - After Me. Let's show ISIS what that means.""
 

 

 
A friend of hers from the IDF told the Journal that he remembered Rosenberg as ""a cute lady with a strong ideology."" On Twitter, her tagline is: ""On a spiritual journey and a quest for authenticity.""
Her attraction to foreign battlgrounds aside, the IDF-turned-YPG warrior has a pretty bizarre backstory. She reportedly served a few years in U.S. prison for a phone scam that she ran out of Israel, in which elderly Americans were ""bilked out of millions of dollars, collectively,"" according to the FBI.
Since news of her possible capture broke, friends and supporters have filled her Facebook wall with respects, prayers and side-by-side photos of the Israeli and Kurdish flags.

ISIS members writing on the Al Platform Media forum urged leaders to use Rosenberg as a bargaining chip for a prisoner exchange with Israel.
In a phone interview with the Journal, Emmanuel Nachshon, spokesman for the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, distanced the government from Rosenberg. ""She’s her own person,"" he said. ""As an individual, she’s free to do whatever she wants. We're not in a position to tell her what to do. ... Remember, she didn’t go there as an Israeli. She never said, 'I’m representing Israel.'""
Nachshon said the foreign ministry was aware Rosenberg was fighting for the Kurds, but has not been able to confirm the kidnapping rumors. ""Our researchers are looking into it,"" he said. (CBC News in Canada reports that the Canadian foreign ministry is likewise ""pursuing all appropriate channels"" to locate Rosenberg.)
Asked if Israel was expecting ISIS to try and negotiate, Nachshon said: ""I hear they are more in the business of cutting heads.""

"Report: ISIS kidnaps Canadian-Israeli, former IDF soldier who went to fight with the Kurds","Gill Rosenberg, 31,said last week on Facebook that she was no longer updating her page because she was headed to an area without internet.

Uncertainty abounds concerning the fate of Israeli-Canadian Gill Rosenberg, who was apparently captured by ISIS.

Islamist websites – some of them known to be close, or even serving as a front for ISIS – reported Sunday that the 31-year-old was captured by their warriors during fierce battles with Kurdish fighters in unspecified areas.

According to the websites, Rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves. The websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture, nor did they provide any proof of it.

The ISIS claims do not make clear whether Rosenberg was captured in Iraq or in Syria. The main lines of battle between Kurds and ISIS are in the Syrian-Turkish border town of Kobani – but Kurdish sources approached by Israel Radio reporter Eran Cicorel expressed doubt over the ISIS report. They said Rosenberg was not in Kobani. In the assessment of these Kurdish sources, the reports of Rosenberg's capture are probably ISIS propaganda.

The Shin Bet, Israel's general security service, told The Jerusalem Post that ""there are no further details at this stage.""

Rosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on November 20 that she was handing over management of her account to ""someone else"" and would be without internet access for at least two weeks, until December 8, she wrote. It is not clear where she went at this time.

If the websites' reports are true, Rosenberg would likely be the first Western female to fall into ISIS captivity. Holding Israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further.

Unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, which refused to negotiate with ISIS over their captured nationals, thus giving the impression of laissez faire interest, Israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists.

This does not mean that Israel would negotiate with ISIS over Rosenberg, if she has indeed been captured – or that ISIS would agree to talk Israel, chalking her nationality up to Canadian alone.

It is worth mentioning that if Rosenberg was captured, she would be the second Israeli – of dual nationality – in this position. Steven Sotloff, a freelance American journalist who also held Israeli citizenship and filed for The Jerusalem Report from the Syrian Civil War, was captured by ISIS last year shortly after crossing the Syrian border and beheaded by the Islamist group this past August.

It is also worth noting that Rosenberg breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq, an enemy country which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter. No matter what has happened to her since joining the Kurdish forces – whether safe or in ISIS captivity – there is no doubt that upon return to Israel, she will be arrested and prosecuted, as was the case of several Israeli Arab who joined ISIS and returned.

This is not Rosenberg's first tryst with adventurism – in 2009 she was arrested in an American con scandal and sentenced to four years in jail. This is however, her first serious choice encounter with death.

Rosenberg was born in Vancouver, Canada, and experienced a family crisis after her parents divorced. In an interview with Ma’ariv in 2009, she said that already at the age of 22 she was pursuing a promising career as a pilot of Boeing passenger planes, but decided to leave everything behind and make aliya in 2006. In Israel, she joined the IDF, serving as an instructor for Kenyan soldiers who came to Israel for home front search and rescue training.

Rosenberg said that she had ambitions to join the Mossad, but was hurt during her military training and afterward had money problems.

She met an American friend in ulpan (Hebrew language school) who led her into crime, she claimed. She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme. According to the indictments filed against them, they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, and perhaps even millions, from the unknowing pensioners.

After a number of complaints were filed, a joint Israel Police and FBI investigation was launched. The probe led to the arrest of several suspects and their extradition to the US, where they were tried. Rosenberg served four years in jail.","0"

"Female Israeli fighter said abducted by Islamic State  Read more: Female Israeli fighter said abducted by Islamic State","An Israeli-Canadian woman who traveled to Iraq to fight alongside the Kurds there earlier this month has been abducted by Islamic State fighters, Hebrew media reported Sunday, citing Syrian jihadist-linked media.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, was captured by jihadists near the flashpoint city of Kobani in the past few days, reports said. The former IDF soldier and Canada native was taken after the jihadists launched three suicide bombings in the area, and her condition is unknown.


The reports were not initially confirmed by the Islamic State group. In Israel, the Foreign Ministry said it was looking into the reports while stressing that the websites that carried the information were “of dubious credibility.”

Two Kurdish fighters quoted by Israel Radio cast doubt on the reports. One, an American fighter, said Rosenberg was never in Kobani. Another soldier on the ground said that he had heard nothing of her alleged abduction.

In her last Facebook post to date, Rosenberg wrote on November 20 that someone would be managing her profile for two weeks, and asked that people not message her “as this is not me.”

IS launched an attack Saturday on the Syrian border town of Kobani from Turkey, a Kurdish official and activists said, although Turkey denied that the fighters had used its territory for the raid.

The assault began when a suicide bomber driving an armored vehicle detonated an explosive device on the border crossing between Kobani and Turkey, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria’s powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party.

The Islamic State group “used to attack the town from three sides,” Khalil said. “Today, they are attacking from four sides.”

The Islamic State group claimed three suicide attacks in Kobani’s border crossing point, the SITE Intelligence Group reported. The group, quoting Twitter accounts linked to the militants, said the suicide attacks were carried out by a Saudi and a Turkmen, adding that one of them was driving a Humvee.

The first foreign woman to join the Kurdish forces, Rosenberg set out from her home in Tel Aviv on November 2, stopping in Amman before flying to Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

Rosenberg told Israel Radio that she wanted to do her part for the Kurdish national struggle, and that she was hopeful her experience in the Israel Defense Forces would be useful to the Kurds.

According to Rosenberg’s Facebook page, she served in the IDF’s Home Front Command.

Rosenberg has posted pictures of herself in mountains of Iraq and Syrian Kurdistan.

“In the IDF, we say Aharai – After Me. Let’s show ISIS what that means,” she wrote, using an alternate acronym for Islamic State.

In 2009, Rosenberg was arrested in a joint Israeli police and FBI operation on suspicion that she had been part of a ring that cheated elderly American citizens out of their money by posing as lottery officials and convincing the unsuspecting seniors to pay for fictive services, according to the Walla news site. The members of the ring, which included 11 other Israeli citizens aside from Rosenberg, were said to have stolen up to $25 million.

Rosenberg was later convicted of the crime and sentenced to four years in a US prison, though her term was eventually shortened and she was deported to Israel instead, Channel 10 reported.

The Islamic State group began its Kobani offensive in mid-September, capturing parts of the town as well as dozens of nearby villages. The town later became the focus of airstrikes by the US-led coalition against the militants.

Kurdish fighters slowly have been advancing in Kobani since late October, when dozens of well-armed Iraqi peshmerga fighters joined fellow Syrian Kurds in the battles. The fighting has killed hundreds of fighters on both sides over the past two months.

If confirmed, Rosenberg would be the second Israeli captive held by the jihadist group. Israeli-American journalist Steven Sotloff was beheaded by the Islamic State group in early September. Sotloff went missing in Syria in August 2013, and the jihadists were reportedly unaware of his Jewish heritage and Israeli citizenship until after his death.

"Conflicting reports on alleged IS capture of Canadian woman","KOBANE , Syria, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- There are conflicting reports whether Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-Israeli woman who claims to have joined the fight against the Islamic State, has been captured.
Rosenberg, 31, told Israeli radio she traveled from Israel to Iraq in November to join a Kurdish militia, the only anti-IS group encouraging women to enter combat. IS-affiliated websites claimed over the weekend she was captured near locations where Kurdish and IS forces were engaged in battle, but Kurdish sources told the Jerusalem Post the reports of her capture were merely IS propaganda.

Two messages have appeared on the Facebook social media website since Sunday night, indicating Rosenberg was not taken prisoner. Facebook user Oliver Bruno wrote ""Gill is safe and she is not active on Facebook cause (sic) she has no internet access. ISIS's supporters launched a rumor on social media that she was captured in ‪#‎Kobani which is not true, simply because Gill is at least 300 km. from Kobani.""

The message would imply Rosenberg left Israel to fight but was some 186 miles away from Kobane, a town on the Syria-Turkey border and the scene of two months of fighting.

A later message from Bruno said the head of the YPG Kurdish forces in Kobane ""categorically refuted these allegations.""

Another message from Facebook user Emanuela Siyar Barzani, citing a ""qualified"" source, noted ""Everything is fine with Gill.""

On Saturday, an online form posted a message from a pro-IS contributor, claiming a ""female Zionist soldier"" was captured in Kobane by IS forces, the SITE Intelligence Group reported. Speculation began that the soldier in question was Rosenberg, but there has been no confirmation.

The Canadian government's Department of Foreign Affairs said it was investigating the reports, but did not confirm Rosenberg, who is from White Rock, B.C., had been captured.","0"
"Report: Israeli-Canadian woman fighting Islamic State has been kidnapped by terror group","Online reports in jihadi and Palestinian forums claim Gill Rosenberg was captured by Islamic State group in embattled town of Kobani.

Gill Rosenberg, the Israeli-Canadian who joined Kurdish forces in their battles against the radical Islamic State terror group has been reportedly taken captive by the group, unconfirmed reports claimed.

Rosenberg, 31, is a civil aviation pilot who enlisted in an Israeli army search-and-rescue unit before being arrested in 2009, extradited to the United States and jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said.

Rosenberg said that she had made contact with the Kurds through Facebook, asking them to allow her to join the Kurdish People's Protection Units, commonly known as the YPG.

On her Facebook page, Rosenberg shared her plans for her mission in Syria two months in advance, when she uploaded a picture from Jerusalem showing an Israeli flag next to an Islamic State flag, and continued posting images until her November 1, her final day in Israel.

She later posted pictures from Queen Alia International Airport in Amman, Jordan, and then from Erbil International Airport in Kurdistan. On November 9, she uploaded images from the Kurdish region of Syria and wrote, ""In the IDF (Israeli army), we say 'aharai', After Me. Let's show ISIS (Islamic State) what that means."" A friend wrote, ""Take care of yourself, friend. You are one strong woman, and you'll destroy the Islamic State.""

A source in the Kurdistan region with knowledge of the issue said Rosenberg was the first foreign woman to join YPG, the Kurds' dominant fighting force in northern Syria. She has crossed into Syria and is one of around 10 Westerners recruited by YPG, the source said.

Rosenberg could not be reached by Reuters for comment. A source provided an Iraqi Kurdistan cellphone number for her, but it was turned off on Tuesday.

"The Gold Apple Watch Could Cost As Much As $1,200","A jewelry contact familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that the gold, 18-karat version of the Apple Watch could cost around $1,200 retail when it launches in January. This has been corroborated, based on size and weight, by jewelers familiar with the material Apple is using to make its Apple Watch Edition pieces. It should be noted that this is an estimate and the piece could come in well below that price.

Although there is still some confusion as to whether the watch will be gold plated or actually made of gold, the jeweler suggested that it would be sub-optimal not to make the watch out of solid gold alloy, a decision that will drive up the price. The estimate is based on the leaked design images of the iWatch that appeared this weak.

Chad Rickicki, a watch expert in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania said that a case the size and shape of the Apple Watch in 18 carat gold would cost about $600 to make. The rest – the electronics and markup could double that price.

That doesn’t mean that all of the Apple Watches will rest in the rarified air of haute horlogerie. The lower end sport versions will start at $349 and presumably the standard versions, simply called Apple Watch, will receive a premium over that. The Edition watches, however, are expensive because gold is expensive, even at 18K and intermixed with Apple’s alloys.

What does this mean? It suggests an interesting move by the company to turn Apple Stores into luxury destinations. While I’m sure Prada and Louis Vuitton are clamoring to be given access to Apple’s unique band connectors, the upside for a more fashionable, luxury-leaning Apple Watch display in stores means the company will control quality and, more important, control profits on band upgrades.

Apple is entering a fascinating new world of potential partnerships as is, to some degree, the makers of Android Wear devices. Now consumers are going to have to get used to armed guards standing over cases of (tastefully) blinged-out Apple Watches.","0"
"Apple Watch Gold Edition rumored to be priced at $1200: Will you buy?","Apple has remained mum as to its pricing strategy for the three versions of the Apple Watch to be made available next year, only saying that the price will start at $350 for the entry-level version, likely to be the Apple Watch Sport, which features light aluminum and a sweat-resistant band made from a rubbery material.

But jewelry industry experts believe the Apple Watch Edition, which comes with 18-karat yellow gold or rose gold, a sapphire crystal display and Venetian leather for its bands, will cost around $1,200, with other jewelers estimating that Apple's fanciest smartwatch could be priced as much as $10,000.

Watch expert Chad Rickicki of Pittsburgh, Penn. told TechCrunch that an 18-karat gold case that is the size and shape of the Apple Watch could rack up as much as $600 for the raw material. That does not even include the smartwatch's electronic components and the profit margin Apple plans to tack on to the device. All in all, consumers can expect to pay $1,200 for a gold smartwatch, says Rickicki.

However, other jewelers are not as optimistic, saying that we need to understand the materials Apple used for its smartwatch to be able to peg it at a more accurate price. Ariel Adams, founder and editor of watch blog aBlogtoWatch, says Apple adopted watch industry terminology for the Apple Watch. The term ""18-karat gold,"" he says, likely means the watch is made of solid gold, not gold-plated. Otherwise, Apple would have used the term ""gold-plated.""

The current market price for gold is $1,200 per ounce. If, for example, the Apple Watch weighs two ounces, that is already $2,400 just for the gold. That is not even considering the special process Apple's own metallurgists invented to create gold that is ""twice as hard as standard gold."" Adams says Apple has cheaper manufacturing centers in China than the facilities used by Swiss-based watchmakers, but gold is gold and it is expensive wherever it is crafted.

Adams also points out that there is also the cost of sapphire glass to contend with, estimating that Apple has to pay around $30 to $40 for the sapphire crystal case of the Edition smart watch. Sapphire manufacturing, Adams says, is a long and expensive process where the crystals are synthetically grown in large chambers and then cut into rectangles that are then laminated. Adams thinks the high-end Apple Watch will not cost anything less than $5,000 and could go up as much as $10,000.

""The Edition is going to be far, far less mass-produced than the steel version,"" he says. ""I think it's going to have a much different type of distribution. It'll be a much more exclusive product.""","0"
"Gold Apple Watch Edition Could Cost As Much As $1,200","When Apple unveiled the Apple Watch, the unveiled three different editions: the Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Sport, and the Apple Watch Edition. The latter model appears to be catered to those who are more interested in fashion and luxury as the watch will be given an 18-karat gold treatment.
Sure, we guess it looks good but at the same time, have you ever wondered how much it will cost? Apple has declined to state a price of the Apple Watch Edition but according to the folks at TechCrunch, it is possible that the gold Apple Watch could retail for as much as $1,200. This is according Chad Rickicki, a watch expert who claims that the 18-karat gold Apple Watch would cost $600 just for the case, size, and shape alone, and that combine it with the electronics and markup, could end up being in the $1,200 range.
This is a significant leap over the base Apple Watch which Apple has said would be priced starting at $349, so safe to say it is an interesting direction that Apple is headed if they do indeed price the Edition at over $1,000. Given how Apple’s recent hires have come from the high-end fashion industry, we can’t say this is too surprising.
In fact a rumor earlier this year had even suggested that Apple could be preparing an Apple Watch that could cost thousands, thus making these claims slightly more believable. Either way we expect Apple will announce the prices in the near future as the Apple Watch has currently been pegged for a release in 2015.","0"
"Results: 80% expect the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition to cost under $4500, but will it?","In a poll of 9to5Mac readers, nearly 80% of people think Apple’s 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will cost under $4500. Only 16% expect the gold Apple Watch Edition to cost between $5000-$10,000, and 3.8% expect a price tag over $10,000. The biggest group at 29.68% expect the gold model to cost between $1500-$2500. But how much will the gold Apple Watch really cost?


 
Apple-watch-gold-survey-01

It depends on how much gold, in terms of weight, is actually in the Apple Watch. Apple itself described the model as solid 18-karat gold, but we still don’t know for sure.

We have at least an estimate, however, with Greg Koenig (via Forbes) creating a 3D render of the Apple Watch (above) and estimating around 29.16g, or approximately $1200, worth of gold. Factor in everything else included in manufacturing the watch and Apple’s usual markup and Koenig thinks the watch won’t come in below $5000. Compare that with the hint of a price point close to the entry-level $4000 Mac Pro from the WSJ in recent weeks.

We’ll have to wait to know for sure how Apple decides to price the device (like an iPhone + gold or like a traditional, high-end timepiece), but it appears most consumers are expecting (or at least hoping) for the former.

"Could Gold Apple Watch cost $5,000?","My wrists and I have had a troubled relationship since last week.

Ever since Apple revealed its vast array of watches, my lower forearms have looked up at me and hissed: ""Well? You're going to leave us naked?""

So I spent some time yesterday browsing Apple's site and perusing all the different types of watches that will soon be available.

The fancier model -- the so-called Apple Watch Edition -- does look relatively lovely on tiny female forms. But how much might it cost? All Tim Cook offered last week was that the watches -- the cheapest presumably being the sporty ones you'll sweat all over -- will start at $349.

Then along comes influential Apple observer John Gruber to insert a little informed perspective.

""Apple Watch is not a product from a tech company, and it will not be understood, at all, by the tech world,"" he said.

This incites a kaleidoscope of optimism for those who find tech minds frightfully insular. For Gruber, the higher-end watches -- the Apple Watch made of stainless steel and the Watch Edition adorned with 18-karat gold -- will be competing directly with fancy watches.

What they will offer is a (hopefully) gorgeous watch with some fancy gizmos attached.

It's a persuasive concept, one that makes your standard Rolexy thing a klutzy lump of gold that can merely tell the time and make you look like something of a exhibitionist half-wit.

However, if you want your artistic creation to seem valuable, you have to price it as such. So Gruber wagers that the stainless steel Apple watch will start at around $999. The Edition, however, he places at $4,999.

In his words: ""I think Apple Watch prices are going to be shockingly high -- gasp-inducingly, get-me-to-the-fainting-couch high -- from the perspective of the tech industry. But at the same time, there is room for them to be disruptively low from the perspective of the traditional watch and jewelry world.""

The thing that's missing currently is the full gamut of what Apple's watches will be capable of doing. We've seen the basic hardware, but we don't know that much about the software.

Between now and their launch -- some time in 2015 -- Apple's team has time, surely, to develop and keep in secrecy all sorts of amusing functionality. This functionality will keep your first date enthralled for hours as you waft your Apple Watch before his or her mesmerized eyes.

Not only will you seem to be a person of means, but one who means to know where the world is at.

Even if the fanciest of its watches costs $4,999, Apple still has the problem of obsolescence and general pain-in-the-buttness.

Do you really want an extra item to charge every night? Do you really want to replace your watch every couple of years? Or might there, as Gruber suggests, be a nifty software-update solution so that you don't have to toss it in the drawer next to all your old iPhones?

What's most important here, though, is that Apple is proving ever more that what is conventionally called tech is not its main domain.

We humans are posers, as much if not more than we're thinkers. We sift the world through imagery, rather than substance. Somehow, substance is a more shifty essence than is our world of impressions.

Impressions are instant, substance takes time. There are too many demands on our time for us to bother to dig deep into the substance of everything (or even anything much at all). So we sift our world by looking at it and absorbing impressions.

MORE TECHNICALLY INCORRECT

Man demands iPhone 6 as dowry, report says
GoDaddy makes very funny ad (no, really)
Samsung hires Kristen Bell to help you forget about Apple
Apple's watches will exist first to make certain impressions. Buried a little deeper, however, will likely be a certain substance that is unique to these fashion accessories. This is what Apple means when it says these are the most ""personal"" devices it's ever made.

It's like any relationship. You're first moved by looks. Then you hope that there's something more behind them, something that will be the glue that creates a deeper, longer-lasting bond.

You might choose to pay $4,999 or even more for a gold Apple Watch Edition. But you'll need it to be more than just a pretty face. And that's where Apple hopes to make a killing.","0"
"The gold Apple Watch Edition could set you back a whopping $4,999","The Apple Watch Sport may start at a mere $349, but the product line’s price point could well soar from there!

According to Daring Fireball‘s John Gruber, Apple’s 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition may sell for as much as $4,999.

“Most people think I’m joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000,” Gruber writes in a new blog post. “I couldn’t be more serious.”

Gruber notes that the device might cost $1,999 at a bare minimum, but this is unlikely since the components alone would cost more than this.

While $4,999 would give the Apple Watch Edition the dubious distinction of being both one of the company’s most expensive products and its smallest, Gruber points out that the device will not just be gold-plated, but actually manufactured using 18-karat gold.

With that said, is anyone going to want to regularly upgrade a solid gold watch that costs them the same as a Swiss watch which could conceivably stay in a person’s family for a lifetime?

For the record, Gruber thinks the stainless steel/sapphire Apple Watch will set customers back $999.

Guess we’ll find out for sure in early 2015, when the Apple Watch finally ships.

"Apple Watch Gold Edition may cost as much as $5,000","You want a gold Apple Watch, you say? Then it's going to cost you... a lot. 

The vanilla variant of Apple's newest wrist-worn wearable device only costs $349. However, if you're willing to spend big cash on something that has the Apple logo on it, the company would be more than willing to accommodate. 

According to analyst John Gruber, the gold version of the upcoming device may cost about as much as the monthly salary of a middle-class worker in the United States. Gruber predicts that the gold Apple Watch would cost $5,000. The figure is basically just a guess. However, it's not an uneducated one. 

""Most people think I'm joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000. I couldn't be more serious,"" Gruber wrote in a blog post. ""The lowest conceivable price I could see for the Edition models is $1,999 -- but the gold alone, just as scrap metal, might in fact be worth more than that.""

Gruber claims that Apple told him that the gold version of the Apple Watch is made of solid 18-karat gold. It is not gold-plated. This caused him to revise his guess on the price of the device.  

He based his estimate on the going rate for solid gold watches from other manufacturers. Challenging people to find a solid gold watch that costs less than $20,000, he cited a leaked price list for Rolex from 2012. Luxury watch companies don't set prices for their products; they leave that to their authorized dealers. This means that the products on the price list may have ended up being sold for a higher price. In the list, an 18-karat gold Rolex had a price tag of $34,250.


Gruber suspects that the reason Apple has been mostly silent about the specs for the device is that they don't know what the capabilities of the finished product would be. 

""What does Apple Watch actually do? Or, rather, what does WatchKit allow? We don't know. And Apple is not talking, even off the record. One factor is that the software (and perhaps the hardware internals remain a work in progress). It is far from a finished product,"" he said. 

Aside from the gold version, Gruber also predicts a stainless steel version of the device that costs $999. It's not clear whether fancier variants of the device would be available with the sport version at launch. Nonetheless, the Apple Watch is expected to ship in early 2015.","0"
"Analyst: Apple Watch Edition Could Cost $5,000","The Apple Watch has garnered its fair share of opinions ever since its existence was made official to the masses last week, and it will be the beginning of next year before we see the very first Apple Watch being worn on the wrists of everyday consumers. The thing is, while there were several different versions of the Apple Watch mentioned, only one price was stated – which pointed to the $349 starting price, and we still have zero idea on how long the battery is going to last, and neither do we have a bucket list of its features. Analyst John Gruber has rolled up his sleeves and figured out that the Apple Watch Edition might just cost $4,999, coming in 18-karat gold/sapphire to boot.
As for the other estimates that analyst John Gruber has come up with, the normal aluminum/glass Apple Watch Sport ought to be the one that sports a $349 price tag, while those with three times more disposable income can settle for the predicted $999 price tag for the Apple Watch with stainless steel/sapphire.
But how did Gruber arrive at the $4,999 price point for the Apple Watch Edition with 18-karat gold/sapphire? Simply because he thinks it will be a solid gold piece, and not gold-colored. Those who have seen the Watch Edition and touched it purportedly claimed that it is heavier compared to the stainless steel version, which means the materials used within could cost a bomb – as reflected in the possible price tag.

"New Twist: Charlie Hebdo Police Investigator Turns Up Dead, ‘Suicided’","BREAKING: INFORMANT? Paris Terror Suspect on US Watch List Met With French President Sarkozy in 2009

21st Century Wire says…

As the dust settles from this week’s terror extravaganza in France, more loose ends are turning up (or being tied up), with this latest bizarre bombshell which is already fueling speculation as to the covert nature of the Charlie Hebdo false flag affair.

A police commissioner from Limoges, France, Helric Fredou, aged 45 (photo, below), turned up dead from a gun shot to the head on Thursday amid the Charlie Hebdo affair. A high-ranking official within the French law enforcement command-and-control structure, Fredou was also a former deputy director of the regional police service.


At the time of his death, police claim to have not known the reason for his alleged suicide. This was reflected in their official statements to the media: “It is unknown at this time the reasons for his actions”. However, a back story appears to have been inserted simultaneously, most likely from the very same police media liaisons, who then told the press that Fredou was ‘depressed and overworked’. For any law enforcement officer in France, it would seem rather odd that anyone would want to miss the biggest single terror event in the century, or history in the making, as it were.

Here is a link to the original report in the French media, which confirms that Commissioner Fredou was indeed working on the Charlie Hebdo case:

“The Fredou Commissioner, like all agents SRPJ, worked yesterday on the case of the massacre at the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo. In particular, he was investigating the family of one of the victims. He killed himself before completing its report. A psychological ‘cell’ was set up in the police station.”

Helric-Fredou-3
EDITOR’S NOTE: It is not yet known to 21WIRE exactly how the fatal gun shot occurred, but if any other past political and high-profile ‘suicided’ cases are anything to go by, authorities will claim that this victim either shot himself in the back of the head,  with his non-shooting hand. In addition, if that were the case, there would also be a lack of gun powder burns on the hands according to the autopsy. 

UK-based investigative reporter Morris108, interviews ‘Phil in France’ regarding this new development:




Even more bizarrely, an almost identical event took place just over one year earlier, November 2013 in Limoges, when the number 3 ranked SRPJ officer had killed himself in similar circumstances, with his weapon in the police hotel. Allegedly, his colleague discovered his body. The prosecution ruled that case was a suicide too, and the police officer had left a suicide note to his family in which he expressed “personal reasons” for his surprising action.

Police commissioner, who had been investigating the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine committed suicide with his service gun on Thursday night.

Police commissioner Helric Fredou, who had been investigating the attack on the French weekly satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, committed suicide in his office. The incident occurred in Limoges, the administrative capital of the Limousin region in west-central France, on Thursday night, local media France 3 reports.
Helric Fredou, 45, suffered from ‘depression’ and experienced ‘burn out’ [according to the official statement]. Shortly before committing suicide, he met with the family of a victim of the Charlie Hebdo attack and killed himself preparing the report.

Fredou began his career in 1997 as a police officer at the regional office of the judicial police of Versailles. Later he returned to Limoges, his hometown. Since 2012 he had been the deputy director of the regional police service.
“We are all shocked. Nobody was ready for such developments”, a representative of the local police union told reporters.
On January 7, 2015, two gunmen burst into the editorial office of Charlie Hebdo magazine, known for issuing cartoons, ridiculing Islam. The [suspected] attackers, later identified as brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, killed 12 people and injured 11, and escaped from the scene. Following two days of nationwide manhunt, the suspects were killed on Friday by French police some 20 miles northeast of Paris.","0"

"Teen Made $72 Million Trading Stocks, Confirms Teen Dominance Worldwide","If we've learned anything in 2014, it's that teenagers are to be both feared and revered. In a profile published over at New York magazine, one 17-year-old New Yorker confirms that he made $72 million trading stocks during his lunch break at his high school. Someone please send help!!!!

Mohammed Islam is the son of Bengali immigrants who live in Queens. He attends Stuyvesant High School in downtown Manhattan. And now he is richer than all of us by an unfathomable margin. The profile of Islam doesn't seem willing to explain where he got the money to begin investing (there is a mention of earning tutoring money when he was nine) but it does show that teens are just as ridiculous and spunky whether they have a few bucks allowance or $72 million in investments:

Mo, a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux-hawk, smiled shyly. ""He's quiet today,"" said Patrick Trablusi, who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses. ""Humble."" And tired: ""This is our third meeting of the day,"" Damir said, signaling to the waitress for another round. ""We saw a real-estate agent, a lawyer, you …""

""Next we're going to see a hedge-fund guy,"" Patrick said. The friends locked eyes and started to giggle.

""He basically wants to give us $150 million,"" Mo explained, a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks.

The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks. ""Freshly squeezed apple juice,"" Damir said, passing them around. ""It's very good. Do you like caviar?""

New York magazine confirmed that Islam's net worth is in the high eight figures. The teen made his money trading in oil and gold but he won't stop there. Though his parents won't let him move into his rented Manhattan apartment and he can't drive his newly purchased BMW (no driver's license just yet), Islam and his team of three teen Wall Street JV investors plan on starting a hedge fund together in a few months.

As they nobly point out, teens get the money:

"The Story Of The High School Trader Who Made $72 Million Is A Rumor Spun Out Of Control","A lot of folks are buzzing about 17-year-old Stuyvesant High School senior Mohammed ""Mo"" Islam who is rumored to have made $72 million from trading.

New York Magazine's Jessica Pressler profiled him in a recent issue.

But a number of folks who know Islam told Business Insider that they strongly believe that the $72 million figure is just a rumor - a rumor that Islam hasn't denied.

In the article, he acknowledged to Pressler over caviar and apple juice that his net worth was in the ""high eight figures.""

A source familiar with the story told Business Insider that Islam is not worth $72 million. The source believes it's a rumor started by Islam's friends or partners that was perpetuated by the New York Magazine article.

Pressler has also defended the story. She Tweeted that she saw a bank statement with the eight figures and is comfortable with what's in the piece. She also Tweeted that New York Magazine ""is not a financial publication.""

Business Insider actually featured Islam on our list of ""20 Under 20"" in finance just over a year ago. He was nominated by his peers.

In a phone interview on Monday Islam's partner Damir Tulemagabetov, who was also in the New York Magazine article, said the $72 million figure isn't necessarily completely accurate.

""Let me put it this way...it's stated as a rumor,"" Tulemaganbetov told us when we asked him if he would deny the $72 million figure. He was with Islam in a car headed to CNBC's studios in New Jersey.

""All the hype, [Islam] deserves it,"" Tulemaganbetov said. Adding that he is ""pretty sure"" Islam is a ""a great trader"" and that he's a ""genius.""

Business Insider asked for audited numbers or P&L statements to prove that Islam's networth is close to $72 million. Tulemaganbetov refused.

Islam himself did not respond to our email this morning requesting the numbers. He also would not get on the phone when Business Insider learned he was riding in the car to CNBC.

The investment club for young traders, of which Islam is a member, sent Business Insider this statement regarding the $72 million figure:

It has been brought to the attention of the Leaders Investment Club that Mohammed Islam has been rumored to have made $72,000,000 through making trades in the stock market. After performing due diligence and talking with Mohammed Islam himself, we have determined that these claims are false and simply been blown up by the media in the interests of sensationalism.

Islam's partner Tulemaganbetov, however, would not be that clear in his coversation with Business Insider.

""We can't just talk about the numbers. It's not just about the money,"" Tulemaganbetov said. ""We're on the verge of a lot of great things in our lives so we can't just focus on providing you the statements. We're on the verge of a lot of great things. We are going to talk to CNBC.""

Again, Business Insider pressed the issue of the P&L statements.

""All those statements...that's good for you. We know what we're doing. We're managing this whole hype and everything. We are trying to work with it. We were never expecting it and never denied. You have no proof.""

Tulemaganbetov told us that Islam didn't expect all the attention. He just expected a magazine article.

""The guy became famous all over the world in 24 hours. He's all over the world. The next thing we wake up and he's famous. This guy is a celebrity all over the world right now.""

Tulemaganbetov told us that they were going to ""make it clear on CNBC.""

We'll be watching.","0"
"New York schoolboy 'made $72million trading stocks on his lunch breaks' - and now takes his friends out to dine on $400 caviar, drives a BMW and has definitely made his immigrant parents proud","He has not yet reached his 18th birthday.

But Mohammed Islam, from Queens, New York, has already made a fortune estimated at as much as $72million - from trading stocks on his lunch breaks at school, according to New York magazine's Monday issue.

The 17-year-old, who started dabbling in penny stocks at the tender age of nine, spends most of his breaks at Stuyvesant High School trading oil and gold futures, and small to mid-cap equities.

Life of luxury: Outside of school, Mohammed (left, in an Instagram shot) often takes his friends out to dine at Morimoto on 10th Avenue, where they feast on $400 caviar, expensive dishes and fresh-squeezed apple juice

Outside of school, he often takes his friends out to dine at Morimoto on 10th Avenue, where they feast on $400 caviar, expensive dishes and freshly-squeezed apple juice.

During an interview for the magazine's 10th annual 'Reasons to Love New York issue', Mohammed refused to disclose his exact net worth, but he admitted it was in 'the high eight figures' and provided bank and financial paperwork to back that up.

The successful teenager revealed he had used his incredible wealth to purchase a BMW - which he does not yet have a license to drive - and rent a Manhattan apartment.

However, his parents, who are immigrants from the Bengal region of South Asia, will not yet allow him to move out of their family home in Queens, according to the New York Post.

Mohammed has also taken to social media to show off his well-funded, lavish lifestyle - regularly posting videos of him partying, playing poker and dancing with numerous women on Instagram.

His hard-earned cash has certainly been beneficial to his parents. 'My dad doesn't work now and I tend to help out with things, and futures gives me that incentive,' said the student.

This photo, also posted on the student's Instagram, shows two women holding up bottles of champagne

But despite its advantages, Mr and Mrs Islam are not overly keen on their son's interest in trading.

'My dad doesn't like [finance] that much,' Mohammed, who has written the phrase, 'More money, less problems', on his Instagram profile, said in an ISSUU interview.

'He says he is ok with me trading, but my mom is skeptical about the market. But they see it as, if I am good at it, then why not?'

A year after he started experimenting with penny stocks, Mohammed was introduced to further financial markets by his cousin. He has since developed a 'life-long passion' for trading.

'What makes the world go round? Money,' he said. 'If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.'

On his LinkedIn profile, the student said he rose to success while trading stocks during his lunch breaks because he 'followed the market, hunted for opportunities and used everything from fundamental analysis to technical analysis and price action to speculate in the markets'.

After having high returns in penny stocks, he moved on to small-mid cap equities, then derivatives, before feeling out the futures market and specializing in oil and gold, he said.

He added he has now developed 'a passion for understanding the markets and a passion for making money', and trades 'mainly based on volatility and volume'.

Let me take a selfie: Mohammed has the phrase, 'More money, less problems', written on his Instagram profile. Above, a female reveller is pictured taking a selfie in another video on Mohammed's Instagram

Speech: Speaking of his passion for trading stocks, Mohammed (pictured giving a speech), who trades 'mainly based on the volatility and volume' of gold and oil, said: 'What makes the world go round? Money'

During his interview with New York magazine's, Mohammed revealed his biggest inspiration in the finance world has been Paul Tudor Jones.

Jones, 60, the billionaire founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, a private asset management firm and hedge fund, ranks as the 108th-richest American, according to Forbes.

Mohammed said that while he had been 'paralyzed' by his losses when he first started trading, he quickly learned from Connecticut-based Jones's ability to get back into the game again and again.

'I had been paralyzed by my loss,' he said. 'But [Jones] was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over.'

Speaking to Business Insider, he added: 'Jones’s personality and technique are what make him so successful and I aspire to become even one per cent of the man he is.

'He went through obstacles, yet still came out on top'

And despite his massive fortune, Mohammed has no plans to give up trading just yet.

The teenager said he and his trader friends hope to start a hedge fund in June - when he is old enough to get his broker-dealer license - and intend to make a billion dollars by next year.

This, of course, will all be done while attending college.

'It’s not just about the money,' said Mohammed, whose ultimate goal is to pave a path in the financial industry that will enable him to become a reputable hedge fund manager.

"Did This Kid Really Make $72 Million During Lunch?","Money makes the world go round, right?

Editor’s Note: Less than 24 hours after this story went viral, Islam admitted to the New York Observer that he’d made it all up and that he merely runs an investment club at his school but has not made any money in the stock market.

Lunchtime: it’s that essential break in the day when you get to catch up with friends, check your feeds, eat some crappy lunch line food and, oh, if you’re 17-year-old Mohammed “Teen Wolf” Islam, allegedly rake in $72 million playing the stock market.

New York magazine reported that the Queens, New York, teen made millions of dollars during his lunch breaks, which he used to buy a new BMW (which he can’t drive yet because he doesn’t have a license right now) and rent an apartment in the city. And though his parents won’t let him move out of their house just yet, the president of Stuyvesant High School’s Investment Club seems set for life before he even walks at graduation.

The quiet son of Bengali immigrants has been profiled in his school paper and landed on a list of young money hustlers to watch in the Business Insider. When New York recently caught up with him and pal Damir Tulemaganbetov, the pair chowed down on caviar and green drinks as revealed that they were weighing an offer from a “hedge fund guy” who they said wanted to give them $150 million to invest.

Now, along with two friends, Mohammed plans to launch his own hedge fund in June, when he turns 18 and can officially get his broker-dealer license. The trio also plan to go to college next year, but they’re not worried about Psych 101 getting in the way of their ultimate goal: $1 billion. “By next year!” said pal Damir Tulemaganbetov. “But it’s not just about money. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers …”

Damir likened Mohammed to “Wolf of Wall Street” anti-hero Jordan Belfort, who, coincidentally, also got his start in penny stocks. After a cousin showed Mohammed how to trade the stocks, the teen got hooked on it, but got spooked after losing a bunch of money he’d made tutoring… as a 9 year-old.

“I had been paralyzed by my loss,” said Mohammed, who went on to study hedge fund managers and try to learn their secrets. He graduated to trading oil and gold and while he wouldn’t confirm the widely reported $72 million figure, Islam said his net worth is in the “high eight figures.”

“It all comes down to this,” he said. “What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”","0"
"Teen Makes $72 Million on the Stock Market","Kids these days. 

New York Magazine recently profiled Mohammed Islam, a 17-year-old senior at Manhattan's Stuyvesant High School who decided to start trading stocks during his lunch break and found himself all the richer for it. 

$72 million richer, to be precise. 

Islam, the son of Bengali immigrants from Queens, is the president of the school's Investment Club and has been profiled by Business Insider for his financial acumen. Mo, as he's known, won't disclose his full net worth but says it's in ""the high eight figures."" 




Mo's got an apartment in Midtown Manhattan, though his parents won't let him move out of their house until he's 18. He bought a BMW, but he doesn't have a license to drive it – his dad drives him on inspirational tours past the home of his idol, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, a hedge-funder and private asset manager who's ranked the 108th richest American, according to Forbes. 

Islam recalls that, when he first experimented with penny stocks (at the tender age of 9), he lost some of the money he'd saved up from tutoring, which caused him to swear off trading briefly. But he was reinvigorated by Jones's story and quotes his idol: ""You learn more from your losses than from your gains."" 

From all appearances, Islam's learned plenty.","0"
"Doctors confirmed the first case of death from ingesting GMOs","Madrid | The doctors of the Hospital Carlos III confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first human death caused by eating genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died of anaphylaxis after eating recently developed tomatoes with fish genes, causing a violent and deadly allergic reaction.

This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the Spanish man of 31, who died at the hospital in Madrid in early January. The health of the young man quickly deteriorated after suffering an allergic reaction unexplained, and all drugs used to contain anaphylaxis have been totally ineffective. The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch, were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.

Mr. Ramos was working as a secretary in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, and began to feel sick just after lunch. A number of symptoms occurred, including a rash with violent itching, severe swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure. The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected a degree add'rénaline but his health continued to deteriorate.

The young man was quickly taken to hospital by colleagues, but the medical staff could not identify the cause of the allergic reaction in the time and no treatments or conventional medications seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was pronounced dead a little over an hour after arriving at the hospital.

The young man seemed happy and healthy when this photo was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before his death.
The young man seemed happy and healthy when this photo was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before his death.
Forensic scientists and experts from the hospital Carlos III had to perform a wide battery of tests and analysis before we can accurately determine what caused the death of Mr. Ramos, and this because of an allergic reaction to seafood, because the only things he had swallowed before his death were bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich accompanied by a cocacola light. They were surprised when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested allergens contained not only related to fish, but also some antibiotic resistance genes that had prevented the white blood cells of M. Ramos to save his life.

""At first we thought there had been some form of contamination of food, contact with fish or seafood during the preparation"" , explained Dr. Rafael Pérez-Santamarina. ""It ' is that when we tested the tomato itself, we noticed that it contained certain allergens commonly found in seafood. We did a lot of different analyzes and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of allergens that killed Mr. Ramos. ""

Several experiments on GMOs produced horrible tumors and even killed rats in laboratories, but most of GM products on the market were considered harmless to humans.
Several experiments on GMOs produced horrible tumors and even killed rats in laboratories, but most of GM products on the market were considered harmless to humans.
 

Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed linked to the ingestion of genetically modified foods. It contradicts most studies on GMOs that have concluded that genetically modified current market crops were edible and without dangers.

A team of scientists led by the University of Nebraska had anticipated this problem in 1996, when they found that the protein of a walnut in Brazil, introduced to improve the nutritional quality of GM soy was able to cause an allergic reaction in Brazil. However, this problem has been rejected by most scientists as unlikely as it could easily be avoided with appropriate safety tests. Soybean genes injections in Brazil nuts were effectively abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused the death of Mr. Ramos was not enough to be tested and risk of death had not been identified before marketing.

The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality, which placed the order of Portuguese origin tomatoes that have infected the young man, demanded that they be repatriated and removed from shops and markets for reasons security. More than 7,000 tons of tomatoes will be seized across the country by ministry inspectors and officials of public safety.

The ministry also made ​​a public announcement about the death of Mr. Ramos in which he offers his condolences to his family and added that ""immediately request further research on the subject, to determine if other food products GM on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population.

"PICTURES: Shocking Pictures Comparing US School Lunches to Other Countries Goes Viral","Since the program’s inception, Michelle Obama’s Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act has offended the sensibilities of the entire nation.

Conservatives found the program to be invasive, thrusting D.C.’s hand into local education matters. Educators found the program wasted enormous amounts of food and money. Parents found the lunches far too light to be considered “meals.” And school children everywhere took to the Internet with pictures of the gruesome dishes the program sloshed onto their cafeteria trays every day.
 
Those pictures did massive amounts of damage to Michelle’s pet program, but now an even worse PR disaster rears its head. This week the U.K. Daily Mail ran pictures of what other countries feed their school children. The comparison is stark … and humiliating for the United States.

The “meal” above featuring an orange slice, a puddle of either apple sauce or a pulverized slice of peach or pear, and what looks like lumpy chipped beef without the toast is one of the dishes that complies with Michelle’s totalitarian program.

Compare this insult to parents, palettes and taxpayers alike with what other nations feed their school children. The contrast below is striking to say the least.

There you have it. Those are samples from a bankrupt Mediterranean nation, a former second-world nation, a financially stricken European nation, a favela-ridden South American nation and some of our other allies.

Every single one manages to feed their schoolchildren in a more thorough, appetizing and seemingly humane way than the world’s lone remaining superpower (H/T U.K. Daily Mail).

What Michelle Obama has done to our children’s food is a national disgrace, and she should hang her head in shame.

"The school lunches that shame America: Photos reveal just how meager US students' meals are compared to even the most cash-strapped of nations","Mouthwatering photos of school lunches served around the world reveal even children in Ukraine, Estonia and Greece are treated to delectable meals each day. School children in America, meanwhile, aren't nearly so lucky.

Whereas a kid in France might be treated to a juicy steak and a hunk of brie, the richest country in the world's youths are more likely to receive unidentified meat served alongside little more than a starch like white pasta, fries or a roll.

The contrasts between America's school meals and those in far less fortunate economies are stark and suggest Michelle Obama's push for more healthful lunches nationwide may not be enough.

What is it? School lunches in the United States stand in stark contrast to the wholesome and in some cases even decadent meals served to kids in other markedly less fortunate nations

The first new school lunch standards championed by Michelle Obama have been phased in over the last several school years.

In addition to whole grain requirements, the rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. While many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly.

Backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag #thanksMichelleObama. If these pictures are any indication, schools have responded to the rules by cutting down on portions to reduce fat and calories rather than by using potentially more costly ingredients.

Meanwhile, the widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently.

Photos of the meals appear on Sweetgreen.com.

But in the UK and US, lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin.

What children in other countries eat (clockwise from top left): Ukraine's version of sausage and mash; Brazil's plantains, rice and black beans; beetroot salad and pea soup in Finland and steak with beans and carrots in France (photo courtest Sweetgreen)

South Indian school children eat off a thali plate which has white rice, sambar (dhal), smoked gourd vegetable stir-fry, curd, buttermilk and kesari, a type of sweet dessert made from semolina

The school lunch comparisons were revealed by Sweetgreen, a chain of US restaurants, and website Never Seconds, run by Scottish schoolgirl Martha Payne, who logs her thoughts and experiences of eating school meals at her primary school in Lochgilphead, Scotland.

The 12-year-old launched the blog in 2012 as a school writing project with assistance from her father, David,

Written under the pseudonym 'VEG' (Veritas Ex Gustu – truth from tasting), with the subtitle 'One primary school pupil's daily dose of school dinners', the blog features daily entries on the $3 school meal that Martha/ 'VEG' has chosen that day, her thoughts on the food and its quality, a count of the number of hairs, a health rating, a picture, and marks out of 10 based on a 'Food-o-Meter'.

Martha, who has been invited to talk in international conferences is currently raising money for Scottish charity Mary's Meals, through her JustGiving page.

Mary's Meals - which began in 2002 as a one-off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and South America.

The surprising pictures show just how the UK and US measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren.

While the majority of lunches feature fresh foods, US tray is packed with processed items.

Similarly the typical UK school lunch is sadly lacking in fresh vegetables, featuring a baked potato, sausage and beans from a tin, and a half corn on the cob with a melon slice to follow.

Lunch in an Estonian school is rice with a piece of meat and purple cabbage. They also have bread and a get a cup of chocolate drink

Balanced diet: Italian children get pasta, fish, two kinds of salad, rocket and caprese, a bread roll and grapes (courtesy Sweetgreen)

In Finland lunch is mainly a vegetarian affair of pea soup, carrots, beetroot salad, crusty roll and sweet pancake with berries to finish

School lunch in Alba, Spain (left): white flesh peaches, strawberries and yogurt melts, cous-cous, broccoli, cucumbers and roasted salmon; (right): Poached apple pears, strawberries and blue berries, boiled swede and fresh garden peas

In France, children start their meal with a generous slab of Brie.

This is followed by a hearty portion of rare steak, served with two types of vegetables - carrots and green beans.

And you won't find sweets on this lunch tray. The healthy theme continues into dessert, with the young ones tucking into kiwi fruit and apples.

The South Korean lunch is equally as impressive.

A milky fish soup to start followed by a serving of stir fried rice with tofu, broccoli and peppers. On the side is kimchi, the traditional Korean condiment of fermented cabbage.

In Scandinavia, Finnish schools dish up a vegetarian lunch of pea soup, beetroot salad, carrots and a roll. For pudding there is pannakkau, a sweet pancake served with strawberries and blueberries.

"Iraq shoots down 2 UK planes delivering weapons to ISIL","Iraq's army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.

""The Iraqi Parliament's National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,"" Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

""We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL's control in Al-Baqdadi region,"" the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.

Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition's planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.

""There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition's military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),"" he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

""The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, ""These documents are given to the investigation committee ... and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.""

Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.

""The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,"" Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.

He said the coalition's support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, ""The coalition has not targeted ISIL's main positions in Iraq.""

In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are ""not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month"".

Gharawi added that ""the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.""

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that ""unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city"".

Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.

""The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,"" Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.

""The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,"" she added.

Hababi said that the coalition's precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.

In late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.

Field sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.

In October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.

“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group - while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition's and the US' claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.

The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.

The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.

Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.

The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL's deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.","0"
"Iraqi Army Downs 2 UK Planes Carrying Weapons for ISIL","TEHRAN (FNA)- Iraq's army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.
""The Iraqi Parliament's National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,"" Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

""We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL's control in Al-Baqdadi region,"" the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.

Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition's planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.

""There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition's military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),"" he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

""The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, ""These documents are given to the investigation committee ... and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.""

Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.

""The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,"" Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.

He said the coalition's support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, ""The coalition has not targeted ISIL's main positions in Iraq.""

In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are ""not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month"".

Gharawi added that ""the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.""

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that ""unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city"".

Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.

""The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,"" Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.

""The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,"" she added.

The incident was reported by foreign and alternative media but not mentioned by the establishment media in the U.S. Europe.


Hakem al-Zameli, a senior Iraqi legislator, added that the current government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from security forces in al-Anbar province about flights airdropping weapons to ISIS.

He said the U.S. wants to promote chaos in Iraq and does this by supporting the Islamic State.

Other Iraqi lawmakers are complaining about the situation.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the al-Ahad news website quoted the head of the al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

Weapons made in Europe and Israel were also discovered in Ramadi, Tarmouz said.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations,” he said.

In December Iranian state media claimed U.S. military aircraft dropped weapons in areas held by the Islamic State for a second time.

Infowars.com reported:

Iraqi volunteers fighting against IS in the Yathrib and Balad districts in Iraq’s Salahuddin Province reported the air drops.

Iraq claims it now has the upper hand in the battle to regain territory from the terrorist group.

In October a purported errant airdrop of weapons fell into the hands Islamic State fighters outside Kobani in Syria.

In November Iraqi intelligence sources said the U.S. is actively supplying ISIS with weapons.

“The Iraqi intelligence sources reiterated that the US military planes have airdropped several aid cargoes for ISIL terrorists to help them resist the siege laid by the Iraqi army, security and popular forces,” a report stated.

“What is important is that the US sends these weapons to only those that cooperate with the Pentagon and this indicates that the US plays a role in arming the ISIL.”
In July, Infowars.com reported on the large amount of U.S. weapons captured by ISIS.

In addition to combat ground vehicles and artillery previously acquired from the Iraqi military, the trove taken form U.S. bases included more than 50 155mm M-198 artillery batteries and 4,000 PKC machine guns.

The acquisition of sophisticated weapons converted ISIS from a terrorist group into an army capable of waging conventional war in Iraq and Syria.","0"

"HORROR: ISIS Fighters Have Reportedly Contracted Ebola","The World Health Organization is looking into reports that ISIS fighters in Iraq have been showing up at hospitals with Ebola symptoms.

According to the pro-government Iraqi newspaper al Sabaah, an unknown number of ISIS militants have shown up at a hospital in the militant-controlled city of Mosul, about 250 miles north of Baghdad. The paper reported that foreign terrorists brought the disease into Mosul from “several countries” in Africa. (RELATED: ISIS Massacred Every Man And Boy Over 15 In Muslim Town)

It’s not yet clear whether the ISIS extremists actually have Ebola or another disease. Ebola symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and unexplained bleeding and bruising — problems which could also be attributed to malaria or yellow fever. And doctors in Mosul might be unable to even test for Ebola.

WHO spokeswoman Christy Feig said the organization is reaching out to officials in the ISIS-held area to offer help if the disease does turn out to be Ebola. However, United Nations workers are not allowed to work in ISIS-controlled areas in either Iraq or Syria, so a UN operation to help either ISIS militants or any civilians in the areas who contract Ebola is unlikely.

Feig told Mashable that there’s been no official notification from the Iraqi government that the terrorists’ disease is, in fact, Ebola.

ISIS is against western science and medicine as a rule, but apparently several militants have taken to hospitals with Ebola-like symptoms anyway. Since taking control of Mosul in June 2014, ISIS has taken to executing doctors that refuse to treat them.

Kurdish news website Rudaw reported in Nov. 2014 that ISIS executed six doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded fighters, in addition to kidnapping six merchants for failing to pay a monthly tax to ISIS. The group reportedly executed two more doctors just last week.

The U.S. has been hitting ISIS with air strikes since mid-November and the Pentagon confirmed in December that the strikes have killed around 1,000 fighters, including three senior ISIS officials.

An Ebola outbreak, however unlikely, probably wouldn’t help matters much.

"Iraqi media says ISIS militants have contracted Ebola","Reports that Islamic State militants in Mosul have contracted Ebola swirled though Iraqi media sources on Wednesday. World Health Organization officials said they haven't confirmed the cases, but the organization has reached out to offer assistance.

Three outlets reported that Ebola showed up at a hospital in Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad that's been under ISIS control since June 2014. The reports, however, have perpetuated mostly in pro-government and Kurdish media.

""We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,"" Christy Feig, WHO's director of communications told Mashable.

Feig added that WHO is in the process of reaching out to government officials in Iraq to see if they need help investigating the cases, a task that could be a challenge, given the restrictions that would come with operating in ISIS-controlled territory.

It's unclear if any disease experts or doctors in Mosul are even able to test for the Ebola virus. A Kurdish official, who was convinced the cases are Ebola, told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants' symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus.

However, Ebola symptoms — nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising — are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases, including malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever viruses and the Marburg virus. Also, most confirmed Ebola cases in this recent outbreak have originated in West Africa.

Citing an unnamed source in a Mosul hospital, Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said the disease arrived in Mosul from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries"" and Africa.

While ISIS has recruited foreign fighters, very few of them — if any at all — are believed to have traveled from West Africa.

The majority of the Islamic State's African fighters came from Tunisia, according to a Washington Post report. Others came from Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Somalia — none of which reported any Ebola cases in 2014.

If the cases in Mosul turn out to be Ebola — a scenario that, at this point, seems highly unlikely — it would mark the first time the virus had been detected in an area controlled by ISIS, a group that doesn't embrace science and modern medicine.

Over the past few weeks, militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul, according to Benjamin T. Decker, an intelligence analyst with the Levantine Group, a Middle East-based geopolitical risk and research consultancy.

""U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,"" Decker, who specializes in Iraq, told Mashable.

""In this context,"" he said, ""the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.""

The World Health Organization is investigating whether some ill jihadists have contracted the killer disease, two sources at the agency told The Post.

Agency officials are checking if there are Ebola patients at a Mosul hospital 250 miles north of Baghdad, sources said.

Al-Sabah, an Iraqi pro-government newspaper, reported this week that the fighters were being treated for Ebola, while some of their comrades have come down with HIV brought by foreign extremists “coming from many countries, particularly those in Africa.”

“The Ebola virus could be in any area in the world, including Mosul, where they don’t have the measures or techniques to diagnose the virus,” ministry spokesman Ahmed Rudaini told Iraqi media Thursday. “They are incapable to detect it.”","0"

"IRAQI AND KURDISH MEDIA REPORTS: ISIS FIGHTERS HAVE CONTRACTED EBOLA","Multiple Iraqi and Kurdish media sources have claimed that some Islamic State (ISIS) militants in Mosul, Iraq, have contracted the deadly Ebola virus, Mashable reports.

The Iraqi outlets reportedly claimed that Ebola had started to spread in a Mosul hospital. The city, known as ISIS’s most important strategic stronghold in Iraq, has been under the control of the Islamic State since June.

Christy Feig, the World Health Organization (WHO) director of communications, told Mashable, “We have no official notification from the Iraqi government that it is Ebola.” She said that WHO had reached out to authorities and asked if they needed help investigating the matter.

Kurdish media network Xendan reported that ISIS jihadists’ symptoms were similar to those shown by someone who has contracted Ebola. However, it is highly uncertain whether Mosul health authorities have the means, tools, or skill-set necessary to test for Ebola, given the current hostile environment in the area.

In late December, the Islamic State reportedly executed doctors who refused to treat their militant jihadis. The Washington Post said of the ongoing situation in Mosul, “Services are collapsing, prices are soaring, and medicines are scarce in towns and cities across the ‘caliphate’ proclaimed in Iraq and Syria by ISIS.”

Iraq’s pro-government Al Sabaah (The Morning) daily newspaper reported that Ebola made its way into Mosul through Africa-based Islamist “terrorists” who then linked up with ISIS. Mashable notes, however, that the majority of ISIS recruits in Africa have come from countries that have not reported any Ebola cases, such as Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Libya, and others.

Meanwhile, Mosul’s liberation remains a strategic priority for Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition. Mosul has been described as ISIS’s de facto capital in Iraq. While under ISIS control, many of the city’s one million residents have lived under fear of severe punishment or execution should they not comply with the jihadists’ mandates.","0"

He added, “ISIS had proof that these militants were infected with Ebola.”

However, most of the Islamic State’s Africa-based recruits have come from countries where Ebola has not had a documented presence. It also remains unclear whether Mosul health officials would even have the means, training or education necessary to test for Ebola.

ISIS Executes Nearly 2,000 People in Syria in Six Months

An unconfirmed number of jihadists apparently sought treatment at the hospital in Mosul, which was captured by ISIS earlier this year. Local newspaper al Sabaah has claimed that the virus was brought to Mosul by terrorists arriving from several countries in Africa.

As of the end of 2014, the total death count from the largest Ebola outbreak in history stands at 7,890 people, while over 20,000 have been diagnosed with the disease, for which there is no cure.

The West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been the hardest hit. While the former two have seen the transmission rate go down significantly in the past couple of months, Sierra Leone remains in a fierce battle to contain the virus.

ISIS captured several cities across Iraq and Syria in 2014, and has been seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region.

Confirmation of Ebola cases will likely be difficult, however, as U.N. workers are prohibited from entering militant-controlled areas.

The militants have become known for executing prisoners, including women and children, and giving Christians and other religious minorities an option to convert to Islam, pay a tax or be killed. Over a dozen doctors have reportedly been executed by ISIS in recent weeks for refusing to treat their injured fighters.

The Daily Mail pointed out that there is no information on whether doctors still working in Mosul are trained or equipped to fight a possible Ebola outbreak.

Since Ebola shares symptoms with other diseases including malaria and yellow fever, it is also possible that the cases so far have been misdiagnosed.

It is also not know how many fighters from West African countries could have joined ISIS, though tens of thousands of foreigners and several other jihadist groups have reportedly rallied under the Islamic State banner.

Nigerian terror group Boko Haram also pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014 — Nigeria experienced its own scare with Ebola after a number of cases of the virus were reported, but the country was declared Ebola-free by October.","0"
"ISIS fighters 'have contracted Ebola': World Health Organisation investigating reports militants showed up at Iraqi hospital with lethal disease","The World Health Organisation is investigating reports that ISIS militants have been showing up at an Iraqi hospital with Ebola.

According to three media outlets an undisclosed number of militants displaying signs of the disease attended a hospital in the ISIS-held city of Mosul, 250 miles north of Baghdad.

While the reports, from Kurdish and pro-Iraqi sources, remain unconfirmed, WHO spokesman Christy Feig said the group are trying to reach out to officials in ISIS-held areas to offer help.

Infection: Several ISIS militants have arrived at a hospital in Mosul displaying signs of Ebola according to unconfirmed reports

UN workers are currently banned from entering ISIS-controlled areas in both Iraq and Syria so it is unlikely an operation in the region could be carried out.

Ms Feig told Mashable: 'We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.'

The symptoms of ebola are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever

Mosul has been under control of ISIS since June 2014 and over the past few weeks militants have reportedly executed more than a dozen doctors for refusing to treat injured fighters.

According to a report in Iraq's pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, the disease was brought to Mosul by 'terrorists' arriving 'from several countries' and Africa.

The symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising, are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever meaning it could easily have have been misdiagnosed.

In addition, very few ISIS fighters are believed to have travelled up from West Africa where the Ebola outbreak originated with most coming from areas where there have been no reports of the disease.

The reports have appeared in pro-government and Kurdish media but if true it could have catastrophic implications for people in ISIS-held areas as the group is against western science and medicine.

It is not known if any of the surviving doctors in Mosul are equipped to test for Ebola or trained to treat patients and prevent the spread of the disease.

"WHO investigates media reports ISIS fighters contracted Ebola","Several Iraqi news sources, including Al Sabah and the website al-Maalomah, reported on Wednesday that several ISIS fighters sought help at a hospital in Mosul, 250 miles north of the city of Baghdad, after developing symptoms of Ebola virus infection.
Citing anonymous sources in a hospital in Mosul, Al-Sabah reported that two cases of Ebola and 26 cases of HIV/AIDS were confirmed by health authorities in Mosul. The newspaper also claimed that ISIS recruits from some African countries brought the virus to Iraq.
The International Business Times UK also carried a similar report, quoting Iraqi news sources.
But a spokesperson for the Iraqi health ministry, Ahmed Rudaini, has denied reports that two cases of Ebola virus infection were diagnosed among ISIS militants in Mosul. The Iraqi health ministry spokesperson said the infection couldn't have been confirmed in Mosul because none of the hospitals in the city have the diagnostic facilities. He said only the Central Laboratory of Public Health in Baghdad has the ability to confirm cases of Ebola virus infection.
Responding to inquiries from Mashable, a WHO spokesperson, Christy Feigh, said, ""We have no official notification that it is Ebola.""
Feigh said the WHO was investigating the reports and would give assistance if needed. But because UN workers are banned from entering ISIS-held areas in Iraq and Syria, it is unclear how the organization would be able to confirm the report or render assistance in suspected cases.
Mashable, however, reports that a Kurdish official who appeared convinced that the reports were accurate told the Kurdish news outlet Xendan that the militants reported at the hospital in Mosul with symptoms of Ebola virus infection.
While Iraqi health officials are probably not taking the reports seriously, an outbreak of Ebola among ISIS militants could have serious consequences due to lack of access to the ISIS-held areas. It is also feared that ISIS militants could use the presence of the virus among its militants as a terror weapon against opponents, further complicating the prosecution of the war against the extremist group.
However, the symptoms of Ebola virus, including vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding in the late stages of the disease are similar to those of several other diseases, including malaria, yellow fever and typhoid fever. Thus, it is possible that the militants who reported at the hospital in Mosul were suffering from other diseases that have symptoms similar to Ebola.
Given the fact that the reports were carried exclusively on pro-government newspapers, it is not possible to rule out that they were designed to cause confusion among ISIS fighters and discourage new recruits from joining the group. It is not known that ISIS has a significant number of recruits from West African countries where the epidemic has been reported. Thousands of foreign recruits to ISIS arrived mostly from North African countries such as Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Algeria and Somalia where there have been no reports of Ebola outbreak.
The Ebola virus epidemic has claimed thousands of lives in the West African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.
Recently, Nigerian news sources reported that ISIS was making efforts to recruit fighters from the country. The report led the Nigerian government to issue a statement urging some Middle Eastern countries to carry out thorough background checks on Nigerians applying for visas.
The report that some ISIS militants might have contracted Ebola comes a few weeks after Benjamin T. Decker, intelligence analyst and Iraq specialist with the Middle East research firm Levantine Group, said that ISIS executed about 11 doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded militants.
Mosul was among several cities ISIS fighters captured earlier in the year 2014. The militants declared an Islamic caliphate in the areas they captured. Mosul, in particular, has been under ISIS control since June 2014. The city has reportedly suffered food, water and power shortages since extremist militants took over. Residents have suffered brutal treatment with reports of executions and enslavement of minorities women and children.
On Wednesday, the US and its allies carried out 17 airstrikes in Syria and 12 in Iraq. The airstrikes in Syria targeted ISIS facilities in Al Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr and Kobani, while the strikes in Iraq hit ISIS buildings and positions around Mosul, Fallujah and Sinja.","0"
"Fears Islamic State could launch EBOLA attack on Britain after fighters 'contract virus'","FEARS have been raised that Islamic State could target Britain with an EBOLA attack after two of the terror group's fighters reportedly contracted the deadly virus.

Sources at a hospital in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul say they have seen suspected cases involving two IS fighters.

They are believed to have unknowingly travelled from their African homelands with Ebola.

The news will spark fears that the jihadists could use the killer virus to hit Britain with so-called ""human-bug bombs"".

Intelligence experts have already urged authorities to be ready for members of the extremist outfit deliberately trying to spread Ebola in the West.

Even if a calculated plot does not emerge, experts fear Ebola could be accidentally spread by IS — also known as ISIS and ISIL — should it tear through the group's ranks.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) was last night scrambling to uncover more information about the Iraqi infection claims.

WHO officials have offered to assist the Iraqi government in investigating any potential outbreak.

However, experts are concerned that the lack of resources and doctors — caused by IS's bloody campaign in Syria and Iraq — could make cases impossible to probe and treat.

IS fighters have reportedly killed more than a dozen doctors, who may have been able to confirm the diagnoses, in Mosul.

Meanwhile Western medics, who would normally travel to the Middle East to help, face terrifying risks of kidnap and beheading by IS.

Ebola's potential appearance in Mosul was reported by three separate media outlets yesterday.

Mosul is 250 miles north of Baghdad and has been controlled by IS since June, 2014.

Al-Sabaah, an Iraqi newspaper, said two cases of Ebola and 26 of AIDS were reported in the city.

Citing medical sources, it claimed the virus had been transported from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries"" in Africa.

WHO director of communications Christy Feig said there has been ""no official notification"" from the Iraqi government that Ebola has been confirmed.

The organisation is trying to contact Iraqi officials to see if help can provided to investigate any suspected cases in rebel-controlled areas of the country.

Meanwhile a Kurdish official told media outlet Xendan the fighters’ symptoms were similar to those experienced by Ebola sufferers.

However, the effects of Ebola can resemble those caused by a number of illnesses, including malaria and Lassa and Yellow Fever.

They include nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, bleeding and bruising.

Middle East-based intelligence analyst Benjamin Decker said IS's killing of medics and its decision to ban Westerners from its territory could allow Ebola to spread rapidly.

He said: ""United Nations workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria.

""In this context the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.""

Hundreds of Britons are believed to have to travelled to join IS forces, with some already heading home.

Security and intelligence services monitor those who come back to see if they have renounced the terror network’s barbaric regime or whether they remain suspected terrorists plotting UK atrocities.

However, the current system may not equip security services for motoring symptoms of the Ebola, according to the WHO, has killed around 8,000 people in West Africa and affected areas so far.

IS is a hardline jihadist group, which formerly had ties to al-Qaeda.

It seized vest swathes of Iraq and Syria in August in a bid to create a so-called caliphate.

"Has Ebola infected Isis militants in Mosul?","Islamic State (Isis) militants in Mosul may have contracted Ebola, according to Iraqi media reports of suspected cases at an IS-controlled hospital in the city.

The government and Kurdish media reported that militants were displaying symptoms similar to those of Ebola. The World Health Organization has not been able to confirm this but has offered assistance to Iraqi officials.

Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said Ebola arrived in Mosul from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries and Africa"", reports Mashable.

However, it is uncertain if any IS recruits came from the Ebola-hit regions of West Africa. Most have come from Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Somalia.

A number of other illnesses could be to blame for the fighters' symptoms. Malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever and the Marburg virus could all be confused with Ebola as they can also cause fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.

IS, a group that has been known to dismiss some aspects of science and modern medicine, recently executed a number of Iraqi doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat militants. UN workers have also been prohibited from entering their territory, an intelligence analyst who specialises in Iraq told Mashable.

"ISIS Militants In Mosul Have Contracted Ebola, Iraqi Media Sources Claim","With the threat of an ISIS terror attack becoming ever more real, Iraqi media reported yesterday that some of the group’s militants have contracted the deadly Ebola virus, although World Health Organization officials have yet to confirm the reports.

An International Business Times article from today confirms that three Iraqi news outlets reported that Ebola showed up at a hospital in Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad which has been under ISIS control since June 2014.

Christy Feig, WHO’s director of communications, casted doubt on the report though, telling reporters, “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.”

On top of that, it isn’t clear whether any disease experts or doctors in Mosul are even able to test for the Ebola virus. A Kurdish official, who was convinced the cases are Ebola, told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants’ symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus.

Nonetheless, Ebola symptoms, like nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding, are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases, including malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever viruses, and the Marburg virus.

Iraq’s pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, reported that the disease arrived in Mosul from “terrorists” who came “from several countries” in Africa.

According to a Washington Post report, the majority of the ISIS’ African fighters came from Tunisia, while others came from Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan, and Somalia — none of which reported any Ebola cases in 2014.

Benjamin T. Decker, an intelligence analyst with the Levantine Group, said that over the past few weeks, militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul.

“U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,” he said.

“We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,” WHO’s director of communications Christy Feig told Mashable in a statement.

Feig reportedly went on to acknowledge that, despite their best efforts to offer help to area officials, if Ebola has in fact reached them, having an impact in an ISIS-controlled area could prove to be challenging.

Ebola reached epidemic levels last year in parts of Africa, and fear that the virus would spread in the United States took over the headlines for weeks this past fall. However, so far, the disease has yet to make any serious impact in the states.

Iraq’s pro-government newspaper al Sabaah claims that the disease has spread to Mosul through “terrorists” coming from “several countries” in Africa.

Symptoms of Ebola include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bruising, and severe bleeding, but any of those ailments could be attributed to a number of other conditions, so it’s not entirely clear if the reported Ebola diagnoses are accurate.

"Biological Warfare on the Horizon? ISIS Soldiers May Be Infected With Ebola","It's what national security organizations have feared since day one-the World Health Organization (WHO) announced last week that they are evaluating jihadist militants associated with ISIS, who may have contracted the virus responsible for Ebola. While the WHO has yet to confirm whether or not the fighters are exhibiting symptoms, the current evaluations of a Mosul hospital 250 miles north of Baghdad are prompting concerns that the fringe extremist group ISIS may in fact be able to obtain a biological weapon unlike anything the world has seen before.

Like Us on Facebook 

Though Mosul has been under ISIS control since late last June, the Iraqi health ministry has issued a press release denying reports from Iraqi news outlets that claim the soldier are definitively infected and seeking treatment in Mosul.

""The Ebola virus could be in any area in the world, including Mosul, where they don't have the measures or techniques to diagnose the virus"" spokesperson for the health ministry Ahmed Rudaini says. ""They are incapable to detect it.""

Over the past several months, the world has watched as threats from extremist group ISIS have come true, from the beheadings of captured prisoners of war to the mass murder of children's schools. And with the possibility of a global pandemic looming over our heads, many are demanding action be taken to isolate the potential vectors as a worst case scenario. Yet, as conflicting reports abound, international health organizations and the WHO are unable to assess the health concern on site, and treat the patients as their own.

WHO director Christy Feig told reporters early this weekend that "" We [the WHO] have no official notification from the Iraqi government that it is Ebola.""

While that may be true, the possibility that the militants may have contracted the virus causes a problematic situation for the WHO, in that ISIS does not believe in modern medicine and an outbreak in an ISIS-controlled area like Mosul could be a breeding ground for the ever-mutating virus. But worst of all, aside from the possibility of possible infection of Iraq, should ISIS isolate the virus for themselves, the entire western world may find soon enough that the Ebola virus could be the worst weapon known to man.

""U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,"" intelligence analyst for Levantine Group, Benjamin T. Decker says.

"ISIS fighters ‘have contracted Ebola’","The World Health Organisation is investigating reports that ISIS militants have been showing up at an Iraqi hospital with Ebola, repots Mail Online.

According to three media outlets an undisclosed number of militants displaying signs of the disease attended a hospital in the ISIS-held city of Mosul, 250 miles north of Baghdad.

While the reports, from Kurdish and pro-Iraqi sources, remain unconfirmed, WHO spokesman Christy Feig said the group are trying to reach out to officials in ISIS-held areas to offer help.

UN workers are currently banned from entering ISIS-controlled areas in both Iraq and Syria so it is unlikely an operation in the region could be carried out.


Feig told Mashable: 'We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.'

Mosul has been under control of ISIS since June 2014 and over the past few weeks militants have reportedly executed more than a dozen doctors for refusing to treat injured fighters.

According to a report in Iraq's pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, the disease was brought to Mosul by 'terrorists' arriving 'from several countries' and Africa.

The symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising, are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever meaning it could easily have been misdiagnosed.

In addition, very few ISIS fighters are believed to have travelled up from West Africa where the Ebola outbreak originated with most coming from areas where there have been no reports of the disease.

The reports have appeared in pro-government and Kurdish media but if true it could have catastrophic implications for people in ISIS-held areas as the group is against western science and medicine.

It is not known if any of the surviving doctors in Mosul are equipped to test for Ebola or trained to treat patients and prevent the spread of the disease. Yesterday the United States and its allies staged 29 air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq on Wednesday, the Combined Joint Task Force said.

"GOP Rep: ‘At Least Ten ISIS Fighters Have Been Caught Coming Across The Mexican Border’","WASHINGTON (CBS DC) – Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., says that at least ten fighters for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have been apprehended while attempting to enter the southern U.S. border.
The California Republican claims that “at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” in a conversation with Fox News on Tuesday. Hunter says that the Islamic terrorists are slipping into the U.S. through the porous southern border as several have already been captured.
“There’s nobody talking about it,” Rep. Hunter told Fox. “If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border. It’s that simple…They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol.”
In August, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, warned that the open border posed an “immediate threat” for terrorist activity infiltrating the country. The government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, said ISIS terrorists were “planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.”
Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that the 1,933-mile southern border with Mexico is the obvious entry point for Islamic State terrorists. He says that information regarding the capture of Islamic State terrorists crossing the border comes directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
“ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border – which they already have,” he added.
“They aren’t flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,” said Hunter. “But they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico…All you have to do is ask the border patrol.”
The Department of Homeland Security released a statement on Wednesday that claims alleging Islamic State militants have been apprehended at the Mexican border are “categorically false.”
“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”
After Hunter’s comments to Fox, one of his sources nuanced their claims, saying that some of those apprehended at the border might be ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army – one of many ISIS enemies.
In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Hunter said he was not backing down on the claims.
“The Congressman was conveying what he knows — and what he was told,” the spokesperson told ABC. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing — it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

Two Republican lawmakers told BuzzFeed News Wednesday suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.–Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured, but Homeland Security officials deny any such thing has happened.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, said four alleged terror suspects were captured on Sept. 10 in Texas. In an interview Wednesday, Chaffetz said the men flew from a Middle Eastern country to Mexico City, where they paid a smuggler to take them to and across the border. From there, the men ended up in a safe house for immigrants. They were en route to New York City, Chaffetz said, when they were captured.

Chaffetz would not reveal his source of the information, but said he confirmed it with government officials. “I had an informant tell me about it and then I questioned the Secretary of Homeland Security,” he said. “I have no doubt about its authenticity.”

The four alleged terror suspects had affiliations with groups other than the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Chaffetz said. He added that they were still being held in Texas as of Wednesday.

California Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican who represents San Diego County, made headlines Tuesday when he said to Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren that he had “asked Border Patrol” about terrorists and learned that several had been captured.

Hunter claimed 10 terror suspects had been caught near the border, including four people allegedly captured in September.

“I know at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” he said on the program.

Hunter’s spokesman Joe Kasper told BuzzFeed News the congressman’s assertion that 10 terror suspects had been captured along the border included the same four people described by Chaffetz. Kasper claimed four other suspects had been captured within the last 36 hours, and pointed to a Judicial Watch story that allegedly “confirmed” the most recent captures to back up his assertion.

Two additional suspects were picked up sometime after the first group in September, but before this week, Kasper said.

The Department of Homeland Security strongly denied Hunter’s claim that terror suspects had been caught near the border.

When reached for comment, Customs and Border Protection referred BuzzFeed News to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which did not respond to emails Wednesday. However, DHS released an identical statement to both The New Republic and ABC News denying that there were terrorists coming across the border:

The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.

But Hunter isn’t buying that explanation. His spokesman told BuzzFeed News Wednesday that they have evidence from reliable sources about “foreign nationals” being captured along the border. Kasper said those foreign nationals may not technically be ISIS fighters, but do have suspected terror group affiliations. Kasper did not identify his sources but said that Hunter’s office remains convinced that the lawmaker was correct.

The issue of terrorists coming over the U.S.–Mexico border has been a contentious and increasingly politicized one.

Among the other claims about terrorists using the border to enter the country, Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said ISIS may be teaming up with Mexican drug cartels. Audio recorded at a town hall apparently showed Cotton saying that ISIS could potentially attack people in Arkansas, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.

Cotton did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment Wednesday, but when the Post asked about the statements his spokesman pointed to a series of conservative websites. And like many of the claims about the border and terrorism, the story goes back months and relies on sources who are not named — making it difficult to verify.","0"

The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly said that the assertion that ISIS-affiliated terrorists were arrested while crossing the U.S.-Mexico border is “categorically false and not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground.”

But the vice president of the largest union representing Border Patrol agents told BuzzFeed News on Thursday that DHS — which oversees the Border Patrol — is incorrect. And he said, the incident highlights the need for more funding for the Border Patrol,

“I haven’t been able to outright confirm that it happened, but from what I have heard it sounds very credible,” said Shawn Moran, the vice-president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents some 17,000 Border Patrol employees, “From what people have read to me, from what they say they have seen in documents, it seems pretty legit.”

Moran admitted he had not seen the document himself. He added that he did not know the name of the official who prepared the report, or what agency did that official work for, but that his “instincts told” him the official was with the Border Patrol. He also declined to tell BuzzFeed News who had told him about the report in the first place.

When asked what would be the appropriate response to the alleged incident, Moran said that the Border Patrol needs more funding and more people to do its job and prevent ISIS from entering the U.S. again.

A spokeswoman with the Department of Homeland Security declined to discuss Moran’s specific statements, but insisted that “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

Moran’s statements Thursday followed allegations from two Republican lawmakers who told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday that suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.–Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured.

The persistence of these rumors may stem from the arrests in September of four people with suspected ties to terrorism that were later found to be unfounded, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said in a speech Thursday.

“Four individuals were arrested, their supposed link to terrorism was thoroughly investigated and checked, and in the end amounted a claim by the individuals themselves that they were members of the Kurdish Worker’s Party – an organization that is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq,” said Johnson. “Nevertheless, these individuals have been arrested for unlawful entry, they are detained, and they will be deported.”

Reports that terrorists affiliated with Islamist groups have tried to enter the United States through the southern border have circulated around the web for months, even before ISIS became a household term.

In July, for example, members of a volunteer armed militia told Breitbart News they were concerned because they had found what they thought was a “Muslim Prayer Rug” in the Arizona desert.

Thus far, the threat embodied by that alleged rug has failed to materialize.","0"

A Republican congressman claimed Tuesday that ""at least 10"" Islamic State ""fighters"" have been caught trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border into Texas, though an administration official denied it.

Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said he learned the information from the Border Patrol, warning that the alleged attempts to cross into the U.S. raise serious security concerns.

""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" he told Fox News. ""They aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.""

Hunter continued: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""

He claimed Border Patrol ""caught them,"" but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

But Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the information -- that about 10 individuals with ""known ISIS affiliations"" -- came from a ""high-level source within the Border Patrol.""

""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Kasper said. ""It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it's been that way for a long time and we don't expect that to change.""

Obama administration officials previously have downplayed the threat of Islamic State militants infiltrating the U.S. through the southern border, as warnings about that possibility have circulated.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in an interview with Fox News last week, acknowledged reports that four men with suspected terror ties had been apprehended at the southern border in Texas and questioned. But Johnson said they were ""scrutinized very, very carefully"" and officials found ""no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism.""

Border Patrol and Homeland Security sources also told Fox News that they have not been able to substantiate Hunter's claim. They said between Sept. 23 and Oct. 6, only five illegal immigrants from ""special interest"" countries were arrested at the Texas border -- and they were from Bangladesh.

The four men that Johnson referred to were actually Kurds, Fox News is told.

Johnson, at a hearing last month, stressed that the government had ""no specific intelligence or evidence to suggest at present that ISIL is attempting to infiltrate this country though our southern border.""

At the same hearing, National Counterterrorism Center head Matthew Olsen also said: ""There has been a very small number of sympathizers with ISIL who have posted messages on social media about this, but we've seen nothing to indicate there is any sort of operational effort or plot to infiltrate or move operatives from ISIL"" into the U.S. through the southern border.

Still, Johnson said the U.S. needs to be ""vigilant"" and aware of the possibility of ""potential infiltration by ISIL or any other terrorist group.""

The union representing America's immigration caseworkers also sounded an urgent warning last month about the threat. Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, alleged the administration has made it easier for terrorists to ""exploit"" the country's visa policies and enter the homeland.

He complained that the administration has ""widened the loophole"" they could use through the asylum system, and has restricted agents from going after many of those who overstay their visas.

Further, he warned that executive orders being contemplated by President Obama would ""legalize visa overstays"" and raise ""the threat level to America even higher."" He said there is ""no doubt"" many are already being ""targeted for radicalization.""

"GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter Claims 'At Least' 10 ISIS Fighters Apprehended On Texas Border","Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) claimed Tuesday that ""at least"" 10 Islamic State fighters were apprehended while attempting to enter the U.S. at its southern border.

The San Diego Republican said U.S. Border Patrol ""sources"" told him that ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""

""If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border -- it’s that simple,"" he said. ""They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or 10 of them then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,"" he said on Fox News’ ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren.""

""ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons,"" he added. ""The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border -- which they already have.""

Two of the country's top intelligence officials said last month they had no credible evidence to support the theory that militants are operating next door, nor that they are plotting to sneak across the border.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that Hunter's claim otherwise was ""categorically false.""

""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron told The Huffington Post. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

Hunter, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, isn't the first member of Congress to raise the alarm about the prospect of extremists crossing the border. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested last month that such infiltration was possible, and Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) said it was already happening. Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) has also sounded similar notes about terrorists crossing his state's border from Mexico. GOP Rep. Tom Cotton, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Arkansas, claimed Tuesday that extremists were actively collaborating with Mexican drug cartels to infiltrate the U.S. border and attack Arkansans.

Asked for comment on Wednesday, a spokesman for Hunter said the information came for a ""high level source"" and that DHS was ""actively discouraging any talk of IS on the border.""

""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper told The Huffington Post. ""And as for DHS’ statement, it makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing -- it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.

"ISIS Fighters Getting Caught Coming Across the U.S.-Mexican Border?","From the midweek edition of the Morning Jolt:

Say What? ‘At Least Ten ISIS Fighters Have Been Caught Coming Across the Border’

Rep. Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, does not seem like a nut job or prone to wild exaggerations. But last night he said something that should make jaws drop:

Van Susteren: Hold on. Stop for one second.

Hunter: They are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.

Van Susteren: Let me ask a question. You say that they are coming in the southern border, which changes all the dynamics Do you have any information that they are coming in through the southern border now?

Hunter: Yes.

Van Susteren: Tell me what you know.

Hunter: At least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the border in Texas.

Van Susteren: How do you know that?

Hunter: Because I’ve asked the border patrol, Greta.

Van Susteren: And the border patrol just let’s ISIS members come across the border?

Hunter: No. They caught them at the border. Therefore, we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them, you know that there are going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol. That’s how you know. That’s where we are at risk here, is from ISIS and radical Islamists coming across the border. Once again, they don’t have a navy, air force, nuclear weapons. The only way that Americans are going to be harmed by radical Islam — Chairman Dempsey said the same thing. He said that’s where the major threat is here, that’s how these guys are going to infiltrate through America and harm Americans.

Then add this comment by a House Democrat:

Rep. Tim Bishop (D., N.Y.) warned during a recent speech that up to 40 radicalized U.S. citizens who have fought alongside the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL or ISIS) have already returned to the United States, where they could pose a terrorist threat.

Bishop claims that of the 100 or so Americans who have traveled to the Middle East to join ISIL’s ranks, some 40 have returned and are currently being surveilled by the FBI, according to his remarks, which were filmed and uploaded to YouTube last week.

“One of the concerns is the number of U.S. citizens who have left our country to go join up with ISIS,” Bishop said during the speech. “It is believed there have been some number up to 100 that have done that.”

“It is also believed that some 40 of those who left this country to join up with ISIS have now returned to our country,” Bishop said, eliciting shocked responses from some in the crowd.

Is the threat of ISIS terrorists crossing our southern border no longer theoretical? Could the administration really successfully cover up something as big as this?","0"

The Border Patrol ""caught them,"" Hunter said, but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol."" 

A senior Department of Homeland Security spokesman said Wednesday that suggestions that people with ties to ISIS have been apprehended at the southwest border are ""not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground.""
Special:
The spokesman also said there is no credible intelligence suggesting any terrorist organizations are ""actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the information about the individuals ""with known ISIS affiliations"" came from a ""high-level source within the Border Patrol,"" and the congressman is merely ""conveying what he knows, and what he was told.""

Kasper said ""the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing. It's been that way for a long time and we don't expect that to change."" 

Hunter is not alone in saying the Islamic State agents have crossed the border. Last month, former CIA agent Bob Baer told CNN that there are already ISIS cells in the United States, and he has learned from intelligence services that some of the extremist group's agents have crossed the Mexican border. 

While DHS maintains there is no evidence that anyone with terrorist ties has come across from Mexico, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson acknowledged to Fox News last week that four men with suspected ties were stopped at the border and questioned, although officials found ""no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism.""

Johnson also emphasized at a hearing last month that there was ""no specific intelligence or evidence"" showing the Islamic State is trying to come across the Mexican border.

Duncan Hunter said Border Patrol agents have captured ‘at least 10 ISIS fighters’ trying to enter the U.S. from Mexico. The California congressman’s bombshell on Fox News Tuesday also claims more militants may already be here.

ISIS may already be here.

In an alarmist bombshell statement that intersects both America’s war on terror and its fight to secure the border with Mexico, Rep. Duncan Hunter said ISIS fighters have been caught attempting to cross into the U.S.

Hunter, a California Republican and former Marine major, told Fox News Channel’s Greta Van Susteren on Tuesday that Border Patrol agents have captured Islamic State in Iraq and Syria militants trying to get into Texas from Mexico.

“ISIS is coming across the southern border,” said Hunter, whose district includes much of San Diego. “They aren’t flying B-1 Bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.

“At least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” Hunter continued. “There’s nobody taking about it.”

When Van Susteren pressed him for his source, the Congressman replied: “I’ve asked the Border Patrol.”

“They caught them at the border,” Hunter said. “Therefore, we know ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or 10 of them you know there are going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.”

"Lawmaker Says ‘At Least 10′ Islamic State Fighters Have Been Captured at the Southern U.S. Border","Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said Tuesday night that U.S. border officials have caught “at least 10″ Islamic State fighters or people with ties to the group as they tried to enter the U.S. through Mexico, a claim that was immediately disputed by the Obama administration.

“I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” Hunter said on Fox News Tuesday night. “There’s nobody talking about it.”

When asked by host Greta Van Susteren how he knows this, Hunter said, “Because I’ve asked the Border Patrol, Greta.”

The Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman disputed Hunter’s claim on Wednesday morning.

“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” said Marsha Catron. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

But Hunter’s office replied by saying Hunter was told directly by a senior official that people with ties to the Islamic State have in fact been apprehended.

“A high level source within the Border Patrol told the congressman otherwise,” said Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper. “The congressman was conveying what he knows — and what he was told. It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing — it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

Hunter said Tuesday that the biggest risk that the Islamic State poses to Americans is by trying to enter the U.S. illegally and committing acts of terrorism.

“If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border,” he said. “It’s that simple.”

“ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons,” he added. “The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming in through the southern border, which they already have.”

The Obama administration has come under increased scrutiny about border enforcement in light of fears that Islamic State fighters could try to enter the U.S. through Mexico. Officials were already under fire for its effort to ease immigration rules, which many Republicans say has created even more incentive for people to try entering the country illegally.

From the article:

In response to a question about the reported deaths of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and some of his advisors in an air strike, (Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve) Warren  said the U.S. has not conducted any targeted airstrikes against specific ISIL personnel.

“I hope he’s dead. We certainly hope he’s dead, but we haven’t conducted any strikes against him,” he said.

“With every terrorist that we kill from the air, that is one less terrorist on the ground,” the colonel added.

Warren also said this in talking about the airstrikes against ISIS:

Certainly, ISIL forces realize that when American airpower is deployed, their chance of survival goes to nil.”

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was known as the world’s “most powerful jihadi leader” and “the new Bin Laden.”

“The true heir to Osama bin Laden may be ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,” wrote The Washington Post’s David Ignatius.

Many believe that as the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi helped the group eclipse al-Qaeda both in power and relevance in the region.

“For the last 10 years or more, [al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri ] has been holed up in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area and hasn’t really done very much more than issue a few statements and videos,” Richard Barrett, a former counterterrorism chief with the British foreign intelligence service, told Agence France-Presse. “Whereas Baghdadi has done an amazing amount — he has captured cities, he has mobilized huge amounts of people, he is killing ruthlessly throughout Iraq and Syria….

"Iraqi social-media rumors claim IS leader slain","Rumors that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in an airstrike circulated on Iraqi social media Sunday, along with a photograph purportedly showing the bloodied jihadi leader.

The speculation was backed by several unconfirmed Iraqi media reports, which maintained that Baghdadi was slain in a US airstrike several days ago. However, later Iraqi reports said the IS leader was severely wounded in the chest near the Syrian border and was receiving medical treatment.

The reports could not be independently confirmed.

Washington expanded its month-long air campaign to Iraq’s Sunni Arab heartland, hitting Islamic State fighters west of Baghdad as troops and allied tribesmen launched a ground assault on Sunday.

The new strikes deepen Washington’s involvement in the conflict and were a significant escalation for President Barack Obama, who made his political career opposing the war in Iraq and pulled out US troops in 2011.

Previous strikes — since the US air campaign began on August 8 — had been mainly in support of Kurdish forces in the north.

US warplanes bombed IS fighters around a strategic dam on the Euphrates River in an area that the jihadists have repeatedly tried to capture from government troops and their Sunni militia allies.

“We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam, which remains under control of Iraqi security forces, with support from Sunni tribes,” Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said.

“The potential loss of control of the dam, or a catastrophic failure of the dam — and the flooding that might result — would have threatened US personnel and facilities in and around Baghdad, as well as thousands of Iraqi citizens,” he added.

AFP contributed to this report.

"Israel opens dams, floods Gaza","GAZA, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian minister lashed out at Israel on Sunday after it opened its dams near the border with the Gaza Strip, flooding the central area of the besieged enclave with huge amounts of water.

Mufid al-Hasaynah, minister of Housing and Public Works in the Palestinian unity government, told Xinhua that Israel deliberately increases the suffering of the Gazans.

""Dozens of houses were filled with water of the Israeli dams, which were largely opened this morning towards the Gaza Strip. These actions double the people's suffering who live under a tight Israeli siege,"" said the minister.

Early on Sunday, rescue teams and firefighters rushed to the central area of the Gaza Strip to rescue dozens of Palestinians who were stuck in their houses after Israel opened the dams.

Witnesses said that bulldozers were bringing sands to reduce the amounts of water that covered the houses in the area and that several main roads and streets were closed due to the floods.

The Gaza-based Ministry of Interior said in an emailed press statement that the civil defense teams rescued 18 families after their homes were fully covered with water that came from the Israeli side.

Mohamed Abu Shamallah, head of the Gaza civil defense, said that the level of water in the area in central Gaza Strip grew up to three meters and a half.","0"
"Palestine accuses Israel of opening dams, flooding Gaza, forcing evacuations","Palestinian officials say hundreds of Gazans were forced to evacuate after Israel opened the gates of several dams on the border with the Gaza Strip, and flooded at least 80 households. Israel has denied the claim as “entirely false.”

In the wake of a recent severe winter storm in the region, Israeli authorities opened the floodgates to discharge the accumulated water, Palestinian officials say. Residents of eastern Gaza reported injuries as well as deaths of livestock and poultry, caused by the Israeli action which allegedly came without prior notification, Gaza's Civil Defense Directorate (CDD) said Sunday.

Photos of the Gaza Strip flood have appeared in social networks, but the date when they were taken can't be independently verified as yet.


“The [Israeli] army opened the floodgates of a canal leading to central Gaza, which resulted in the removal of sand mounds along the border with Israel,” the CDD announced, according to Palestinian News Agency WAFA.

“Opening the levees to the canal has led to the flooding of several Palestinian homes, and we had to quickly evacuate the afflicted citizens.”

No casualties were reported as a result, but more than 80 families had to flee after their homes filled with water levels sometimes reaching more than three meters, the Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement.

In a letter to RT regarding the issue, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) maintained that“the claim is entirely false.""

""Southern Israel does not have any dams. Due to the recent rain, streams were flooded throughout the region with no connection to actions taken by the State of Israel,” COGAT said.

The flood reportedly forced the closure of the main road connecting al-Mughraqa district and Nusseirat refugee camp south of Gaza city, leaving hundreds of Palestinians trapped in the floods, a difficult prospect for approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel’s assault last summer.

Evacuated families were taken to UNRWA-sponsored (UN Relief and Works Agency) shelters in the al-Bureij refugee camp and the al-Zahra neighborhood.


""Israel opened water dams, without warning, last night, causing serious damage to Gazan villages near the border. More than 40 homes were flooded and 80 families are currently in shelters as a result,” chief of the civil defense agency in Gaza, Brigadier Gerneral Said Al-Saudi, told Al Jazeera.

Local agriculture was also affected, Al-Saudi said. “We are appealing to human rights organizations and international rights organizations to intervene to prevent further such action.”

Further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams, warned Gaza Civil Defense Services (CDD) spokesman Muhammad al-Midana, as cited by the Ma'an news agency. A fast-moving water stream is currently flowing from the Israel border through the Gaza valley and into the Mediterranean Sea, he said.


The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) used to be a unique wetland ecosystem located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It flowed from two streams, one running from near Beersheba, and the other from vicinity of Hebron. There’s not much water left in Wadi Gaza, as water being mostly used upstream in Israel and the stream running through the Gaza Strip consists mainly of untreated waste from Gaza City, which pumps up millions of liters of sewage into the riverbed.

"Hundreds of Palestinians flee floods in Gaza as Israel opens dams","Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.

The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.

Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.

The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.

The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.

Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.

Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.

The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.

Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.

Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.

This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.

In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.

In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning.","0"

"KANYE WEST BARRED FROM ALL FUTURE AWARDS SHOWS","LOS ANGELES, California ( The Adobo Chronicles) – He did it again. Rapper Kanye West reprised his most infamous stunt at Sunday night’s Grammy awards, taking the stage as Beck was accepting the album of the year award. West popped up on stage and moved toward Beck as if he was about to take the trophy from him. Instead, West turned away and quickly jumped down.

Beck beat out both the night’s top winner, Sam Smith, and the category’s expected winner, Beyoncé.

The incident was a repeat of the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when West accosted Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech after Swift’s “You Belong With Me” beat Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” for Female Video of the Year.

“Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’ma let you finish,” West said after taking the microphone at Radio City Music Hall, “but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!”

West was roundly criticized for his action and was even called a “jackass” by no less than President Obama.

After this latest incident, organizers of the major awards shows like the Grammys, MTV Video Music Awards, People’s Choice Awards and the Oscars have unanimously agreed to disinvite and bar West from their respective ceremonies. The television networks that air these awards programs also joined in the ‘West boycott.’

No more Kanye West on live TV! And Beyoncé just lost her most loyal cheerleader.","0"
"Have Kanye & Kim Been Banned From Future Grammy Ceremonies?","Rumors are circulating that are too delicious to overlook. Has Kanye West been banned from future Grammy Awards shows?
Some sources on the World Wide Interweb are reporting that the infamous stage crasher and his wife, Kim Kardashian have been forever banned from attending future Grammy Awards. However, the rapper is still eligible to win a Grammy.

West, who is more famous for his marriage and storming the stage to protest when Beyoncé doesn’t win than for his music these days first caused this kind of controversy back in 2009. Yeezus stormed the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards when Taylor Swift was given the Video of The Year for “You Belong With Me,” over Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies.”
“Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’ma let you finish,” West said while interrupting her acceptance speech, “but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!”
On Sunday night, Kanye again took to the stage, this time when Beck beat out Beyoncé for Album of the Year. He left before he could say anything, but after the broadcast he made his feelings on that particular award very clear.
Kanye very angrily spouted off about “true artistry” and said “Beck should respect true artistry and give his award to Beyoncé.”
After those disrespectful comments, Kanye was allegedly called to task by the powers that be at the Grammys and he and his sex tape famous wife were permanently banned.
Whether this is true or not remains to be seen. It would be delightful if it was true and send a message to Kanye that he is, in fact, not the guy who gets to say who wins the awards. Beyoncé is great, but she isn’t the only artist out there","0"

Those numbers made an impact on the KFC Corporation, they made the decision to include a pot dispensary to be a part of their Colorado franchise restaurants.

Franchisees have the chance to build a foundation into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee.

The KFC Corporation was able to get approval on February 3, 2015 for their Cannabis Retail Recreational Marijuana / Medical Cannabis Occupational Business License.

So far, 42 of the almost 100 KFC franchises that are located in the state Colorado have made this “option”  an addition to their menu.

 Their is actually a humorous comparison due to the south park episode “medicinal fried chicken” having to do with KFC selling marijuana with there famous fried chicken

In the midst of all this a major crisis happens for cartman when his favorite foods at KFC are all replaced with medicinal marijuana stores. Though KFC isn’t going out of business they are adapting to a new trend.

“In order to be successful, a deep understanding of the market is critical to success,” says KFC spokesperson William Rausch. “It’s all about evolution and we are ready to serve the needs of the people of Colorado.”

For the people choosing to buy marijuana they must provide a picture ID showing that they are 21 years or older in order to make a purchase

Coloradans are only allowed to purchase 28 grams at one time, while people who are not citizens of colorado are limited on their purchase only be allowed to buy a quarter at a time

"KFC Locations In Colorado To Begin Selling Marijuana","(ANTIMEDIA) The KFC Corporation just acquired a Colorado licence to legally sell cannabis within the state.
According to some reports, nearly half of the KFC franchises in the state Colorado began selling cannabis last month.
“In order to be successful, a deep understanding of the market is critical to success. It’s all about evolution and we are ready to serve the needs of the people of Colorado,” KFC spokesperson William Rausch said in a statement.

 
Customers who want to buy cannabis with their genetically modified fried chicken will still need to prove that they are at least 21 years of age, with a valid government issued ID.
Interestingly enough, this weird phenomenon is something that “South Park” predicted years ago. In one episode of the hit comedy show, Randy Marsh gives himself testicular cancer with a microwave in order to get a prescription for medical marijuana. In the episode, all of the KFC locations in the town become marijuana dispensaries.
With this bold move, KFC becomes one of the first major fast food chains to offer this extra service, and it is possible that many others will follow in their footsteps. Fast food has been suffering financially in recent years, as consumers become more health conscious. While KFC may not be the best place to eat, the addition of cannabis to their menu definitely signals the beginning of a new era.","0"

"Jordan Vs ISIS: Reports Say King Abdullah II Could Personally Lead Airstrikes After Pilot’s Death","While other global leaders rant their exasperations and anger towards the extremists ISIS fighters and its entire caliphate, one leader may just take matters in his own hands. Jordan's King Abdullah II, visibly shaken and angered over the death of one of his kingdom’s military pilots, has vowed to exact revenge. Reports in Arabic-language newspapers hinted he may don his pilot suit and drop the bombs himself.

Photos have emerged over the Internet of a poker-faced Jordan King Abdullah II who was wearing a fatigue green army uniform. The reports emerged after the Jordanian leader vowed a relentless war against the ISIS right on their own territory. The portal dailycaller said the king leader, a trained pilot, “may fly a bomber himself on Thursday.”

The news of the burning of Jordanian pilot First Lieutenant Moaz al-Kasasbeh by the ISIS happened while the king was in the U.S. King Abdullah is a strong ally of Washington and London. Al-Kasasbeh got captured when the F-16 fighter he was flying crashed over the jihadi Syrian headquarters in Raqqa in December. He had been burned alive in a cage by the terrorist army. In a closed-door meeting with U.S. lawmakers following the video’s release, King Abdullah II said the ISIS will see a retribution it hasn’t seen before.

Safi al-Kaseasbeh, the pilot's father, said earlier the 53-year-old monarch had personally attended to the coordination for the release of his son, which had ended in vain. “The King told me that he was following up personally on Muath’s case,"" the grieving father told the Jordan Times. ""He said Crown Prince Hussein, may God protect him, is no dearer to me than Muath.” The younger al-Kaseasbeh had graduated from King Hussein Air College, the academy named for Abdullah's father.

King Abdullah said they will pursue the black-clad terrorist army until they ran “out of fuel and bullets.” Quoting lines from the ‘Unforgiven,’ a movie led by American actor Clint Eastwood, he said the death of one of Jordan’s sons will call not only for the death of his killers, but also their “wives and all their friends, and burn his damn house down.”

Duncan Hunter, California Republican Rep., told the Washington Examiner that King Abdullah II has called his officials to arrange “more sorties than they've ever had. They're starting tomorrow.” Mohammad Momani, Jordanian government spokesman, quoted by Fox News, said the country’s response to the assassination “...will be swift. Jordanians’ wrath will devastate Daesh’s ranks.”

""All the State's military and security agencies are developing their options. Jordan's response will be heard by the world at large but this response on the security and military level will be announced at the appropriate time,"" Momani said.

Jon Alterman, director of the Center for Strategic & International Studies' Middle East Program, told Fox News that Jordan’s words were not just mere lip service or emotional outbursts. ""Their ability to do difficult things with small numbers of highly trained people is up there with some of the best militaries in the world.""

David Schenker, former adviser to Defense Secretary Donald Rumseld and director of the Arab politics program at The Washington Institute, said Jordan's military force, ""regionally speaking, they are people of high quality.""

"Jordan’s King May Participate Personally In ISIS Raids","Jordan’s King Abdullah ibn al-Hussein, who has trained as a pilot, may fly a bomber himself on Thursday in the country’s retaliation against the ISIS.

Several Arabic-language newspapers reported late Wednesday that the monarch would personally participate in bombing raids on the terrorist group, citing his vow Tuesday to “strike them in their strongholds.”

The king was in Washington when news broke Tuesday of pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh’s demise at the hands of ISIS extremists. Meeting with the House Armed Services Committee shortly before leaving for Amman, he reportedly quoted the Clint Eastwood’s film “Unforgiven” and said that Jordan would pursue the jihadis until it ran “out of fuel and bullets.”

Rep. Duncan Hunter, who was in the meeting, told Fox News that given the ruler’s immediate and vehement reaction, “King Abdullah is not President Obama.”

Jordan, which has been a key American ally in the air war against ISIS, killed a number of ISIS-affiliated prisoners early Wednesday, as it had promised should Kasasbeh turn out to be dead, prior to the news of his immolation. Some have warned that the terrorist group deliberately deployed news of Kasasbeh’s fate in order to provoke a Jordanian overreaction. But public outcry in Jordan before and after the news seems to have pressured the government into a strong response, regardless of strategy. (RELATED: Jordan To Retaliate For Pilot Killed By ISIS)

Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday that “nothing’s going to change” in U.S. policy toward ISIS as a result of Kasasbeh’s murder.

"REPORTS: JORDANIAN KING PERSONALLY FLYING SORTIES AGAINST ISIS","Jordan’s King Abdullah is reportedly personally involved in executing air strikes against Islamic State positions in the aftermath of the terrorist group’s brutal execution of Jordanian pilot 1st Lt. Moaz Kasasbeh.

Shafaqna news and Iraqinews.com claimed to have confirmed with their sources that King Abdullah is personally involved in conducting the air strikes. What remains unclear is whether Abdullah is personally suiting up and flying a plane, or instead commanding units involved in the mission.

“The Jordanian King Abdullah II will participate personally on Thursday in conducting air strikes against the shelters of the terrorist ISIL organization to revenge the execution of the Jordanian pilot [Kasasbeh] by the ISIL,” said the IraqiNews report.

Others on social media have reported similar statements.

Jordanian Author Waleed Abu Nada Tweeted on Wednesday afternoon, “Local reports here in Jordan say that King Abdullah will personally fly and lead the airstrikes against ISIS tomorrow.”

Middle East commentator Joseph Braude wrote on Twitter: “Reports that Jordanian King Abdullah, himself a pilot, will fly sorties on ISIS targets.”

Before assuming the throne, Abullah II was a Major General in charge of Jordanian Special Forces. Abdullah is also certified as a Cobra Attack Helicopter Pilot. In 1980, he joined the UK’s Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was commissioned as a 2nd Lt. in the British Army.

Jordanian air strikes on Wednesday neutralized at least 55 Islamic State jihadists, including a top Islamic State commander who was known as the “Prince of Nineveh,” according to reports.","0"

It comes after the former general told members of Congress that he was ready to exact a blistering revenge against the ISIS terror army for the brutal execution of military pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh - and he quoted a Clint Eastwood movie character to make his point.

According to the dailycaller, reports have emerged suggesting he could take part in airstrikes on ISIS targets today.

California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter told the Washington Examiner that the king quoted the scene where Eastwood's character announces his plan for retribution.

'Any man I see out there, I'm gonna kill him,' Eastwood's William Munny says in 'Unforgiven.'

'Any son of a bitch takes a shot at me, I'm not only going to kill him, I'm going to kill his wife and all his friends and burn his damn house down.'

'He said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn't seen,' Hunter said. 'He's angry. 'They're starting more sorties tomorrow than they've ever had. They're starting tomorrow. And he said, ""The only problem we're going to have is running out of fuel and bullets"".'

'He's ready to get it on. He really is. It reminded me of how we were after 9/11. We were ready to give it to them.'

Hunter told the Examiner that no one in the king's meeting on Tuesday with members of the House Armed Services Committee made any mention of President Obama, who is seen by some anti-ISIS coalition partners as a weak and indecisive actor.

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said after a separate meeting with the king that Jordan would have a 'strong and forceful' response to the the fiery execution.

'The Jordanian response will be more engaged, not less engaged, when it comes to destroying ISIL,' Graham said.

'The king feels that the gloves are off and that it now is time if you can't negotiate with these people, you're going to have to take it to them, and I think it's going to be more than Jordan.'

Obama and Abdullah met Tuesday evening in a hastily arranged meeting just hours after a grisly video emerged showing al-Kassasbeh, who was 26 years old, being burned alive in a cage by ISIS.

They emerged from the meeting, vowing to continue their fight of the extremist group gaining control over large swathes of Iraq and Syria.

In addition, the State Department said Tuesday that the administration will increase its annual aid to Jordan to $1 billion from $660 million to help it pay for the cost of housing refugees from Iraq and Syria – and provide new resources to fight ISIS.

An agreement on the aid will require congressional approval.

In a brief statement, the U.S. State Department said it planned to provide $1 billion per year to Jordan for each of the U.S. fiscal years for 2015, 2016 and 2017. The U.S. fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.

Al-Kassasbeh was captured in December when his F-16 jet crashed over northern Syria, a mission that was part of the U.S.-led coalition campaign against the jihadists.

During the meeting, President Obama offered 'his deepest condolences' to the king over the pilot's death

'The president and King Abdullah reaffirmed that the vile murder of this brave Jordanian will only serve to steel the international community's resolve to destroy ISIL,' said White House spokesman Alistair Baskey.

Obama earlier decried the 'cowardice and depravity' of the Islamic State, saying the brutal killing would only strengthen international resolve to destroy the extremists.

The White House would not speculate on whether the video was released to coincide with Abdullah's visit to Washington, where he was not scheduled to meet Obama.

The president said First Lieutenant Kassasbeh's 'dedication, courage and service to his country' represented 'universal human values that stand in opposition to the cowardice and depravity of ISIL.'

'Today, we join the people of Jordan in grieving the loss of one of their own,' the president added, as his administration reaffirmed its intention to give Jordan $3 billion in security aid over the next three years.

'As we grieve together, we must stand united, respectful of his sacrifice to defeat this scourge,' Obama said after the latest in a wave of grizzly filmed murders.

Jordanian state television said that Kassasbeh was killed on January 3.

The slaying would redouble international commitment to ensure the Islamic State group 'are degraded and ultimately defeated,' said Obama.

The extremists seized swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria last year, declaring an Islamic 'caliphate' and committing a wave of atrocities.

Countries as diverse as the United States, Saudi Arabia and Jordan responded with 'Operation Inherent Resolve,' an air-led campaign to pummel the jihadist group.

US Central Command meanwhile admitted that the Islamic State still had the ability 'to conduct small-scale operations,' despite months of air strikes.

But, it said, 'their capacity to do so is degraded and their momentum is stalling.'

Attacks have hit the group's 'ability to command and control forces; recruit, train and retain fighters, produce revenue from oil sales, and maintain morale.'

Islamic State had offered to spare Kassasbeh's life and free a Japanese journalist in return for the release of a female would-be suicide bomber on death row in Jordan.

Jordanian officials announced the female bomber and other jihadists would be executed on Wednesday.","0"
"Robert Plant Literally Ripped Up An $800 Million Contract To Reunite Led Zeppelin","You can purchase a lot of things for $800 million. Ten Matthew McConaughey’s, eighty-billion pieces of penny candy, my dignity. But the one thing it can’t buy: a Led Zeppelin reunion. Also, a cure for AIDS, probably, but also the Led Zeppelin thing. Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones agreed to a “35 dates in three cities” tour, but Robert Plant was having none of it, and like a poorly written character in an Aaron Sorkin script, he literally ripped up a contract.

[Plant] and the other living founding members of legendary hard-rock band Led Zeppelin were about to ink an $800 million contract with Virgin Atlantic billionaire Richard Branson to play a reunion tour, but the iconic band’s singer ripped the contract to shreds in the final moments, a report said.

Branson was left stunned when the 66-year-old Plant tore the agreement to pieces right in front of the concert promoters, the newspaper said.

“There was an enormous sense of shock,” a source told the Mirror. “He said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given.” (Via)

"Robert Plant Reportedly Tears Up $800 Million Led Zeppelin Reunion Contract","Sorry to disappoint, fans of Led Zeppelin, but it doesn’t look like a reunion will be happening any time soon.

According to a report from UK publication The Mirror, the group’s famed lead singer Robert Plant literally tore up a contract to reunite the band worth almost $800 million, saying the timing just wasn’t right for a reunion tour.

Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin brand fame was apparently behind the entire thing, offering the band an obscene amount of money just to reunite for a few dozen shows. The contract was reportedly for 35 shows in three cities: London, Berlin, and an unnamed location in New Jersey. Each of the three remaining original members would have earned somewhere over $200 million each just for performing, while another $100 million in merchandising profits was to be shared between the group members.

English: Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin

Branson was reportedly also ready to supply the group with their own private jet for the tour. The mogul was prepared to take one of his airline’s planes and rebrand it “The Starship”. The contract also had an extension option to add 45 more shows in additional venues should the band agree.

The other two original members of the group apparently signed on immediately, and Jason Bonham, the son of late drummer John Bonham, was set to step in for his father. Plant apparently met with conert promoters to discuss the deal, and during the meeting actually ripped the contract in two, ending any chance of a regrouping.


While $800 million is certainly a lot of money, it’s not like Robert Plant (or any of the other members for that matter) really need it. Led Zeppelin are one of the most successful groups of all time, having sold around 112 million records in the United States alone (that figure is three or four times that when the entire planet is counted). In fact, they are the fourth best-selling music act in American history, right behind The Beatles, Elvis Presley, and Garth Brooks.

Robert Plant has also had an incredibly successful career outside of Led Zeppelin. He has released fourteen albums, selling additional millions and making his chart history that much more impressive. His collaborative album Raising Sand with bluegrass/country singer Alison Krauss may not have been his most commercially successful, but it was adored universally by critics, and won he, Alison, and producer T-Bone Burnett five Grammys back in 2009, including Record of the Year and Album of the Year.

While the band’s last album of original music, Coda, was released back in 1982, the band has continued to sell well throughout the years, making millions in repackagings, reissues and live album releases. The group’s last show together was in London back in December of 2007, which was a tribute to legendary music executive Ahmet Ertegün. The concert is thought to have had the most-desired tickets of any show in history, as when it was announced, 20 million requests were submitted online for passes.","0"
"Led Zeppelin Reunion: Robert Plant Rips Up $300 Million Contract, Refuses To Rejoin Legendary Band","A Led Zeppelin reunion tour, backed by an astonishing amount of money put up by British billionaire Richard Branson, will never happen — because singer Robert Plant ripped up a contract that would have paid him about $300 million to play 35 concerts with the the legendary band in just three cities.

The information about the aborted Led Zeppelin reunion tour came from an exclusive report in Britain’s Daily Mirror newspaper, which said that the 66-year-old Plant — who during the 1970s heyday of Zeppelin was one of the world’s most successful and recognizable rock stars — simply didn’t believe it was “the right thing to do.”

“They have tried to talk him round but there is no chance,” said an anonymous source said by The Mirror to be close to Robert Plant. “His mind is made up and that’s that.”

According to the Mirror story, the other two surviving members of Led Zeppelin — guitarist Jimmy Page, 70, and 68-year-old bass player/musical arranger John Paul Jones — had already signed their mega-contracts and were ready to set out on the tour, which would have taken them to London’s O2 Arena as well as Berlin and New Jersey.

But Plant just wasn’t into it.

Jason Bonham, the 48-year-old son of original Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, has also signed on to play drums as a salaried musician on the Zep reunion tour.

Led Zeppelin formed in 1968 and were considered the biggest rock act in the world through the early and mid-1970s. But they broke up in 1980 after John Bonham died in his sleep at age 32 following a heavy drinking binge.

Jason Bonham played drums with Led Zeppelin for the band’s one-off reunion performance during the Ahmet Ertugun Tribute Concert in 2007. Ertugun was the record label boss who signed Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records, sight unseen, launching the then-unknown band’s meteoric career.

Branson, according to the Mirror, guaranteed the band more than $900 million to be split among the three original members, for the proposed Led Zeppelin reunion tour.

Plant’s share alone would have nearly tripled his current, already-formidable net worth, which is reported at $170 million.

According to the Mirror’s source, Page, Jones, and Bonham were stunned by Plant’s refusal to take part in the tour.

“It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it. When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock,” The Mirror quotes the source as saying. “There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

Led Zeppelin fans can still get their dose of the legendary band through an ongoing series of remastered reissues of the original Led Zeppelin albums, a project being coordinated by Page.","0"
"Purported Lisa Bonet Twitter Account Suspended After Cryptic Cosby Tweet","After sending a tweet that many observers said they believed was directed at Bill Cosby, a Twitter account claiming to be that of “The Cosby Show” actress Lisa Bonet was suspended. The account was suspended Saturday following a Nov. 21 tweet directed to no one in particular that piqued the attention of many in the media, including the New York Post and Fox News.

“According to the karma of past actions, one’s destiny unfolds, even though everyone wants to be so lucky… Nothing stays in the dark 4ever!” the tweet said.

Bonet starred as Denise Huxtable on “Cosby” and many said they believed the tweet was directed at her former on-screen father, who has of late suffered a devastating blow to his public persona. Public anger prompted numerous partners to sever relationships with the embattled actor and comedian as a result of allegations he raped more than a dozen women during his career that were reignited by comedian Hannibal Buress last month.

The account is no longer on Twitter, but it featured the Twitter handle @Lilakoi_Moon and used “Lisa Bonet” in its full name field. It also included a photo of the actress. Bonet changed her name to Lilakoi Moon while still acting under the name Lisa Bonet.

Cosby and Bonet were rumored to have had a falling out during the 1980s because Cosby did not approve of her decision to shoot a sexually explicit scene in the 1987 R-rated film “Angel Heart” or to pose topless for a photoshoot with Interview magazine. Bonet left “The Cosby Show” to shoot the spin-off “A Different World” but returned after giving birth. She parted ways with the show again in 1991 and chose not to be part of a reunion special.

The @Lilakoi_Moon account had been on the social networking service for a number of months, and before being shut down had garnered thousands of followers. The user sent tweets to verified Twitter accounts belonging to actor Kadeem Hardison and other members of the “Different World” cast. Representatives of Twitter did not immediately respond to requests from International Business Times to explain why the account was suspended.

An account said to be that of Cree Summer, the actress who played Winifred ""Freddie"" Brooks on “A Different World,” told followers that the @Lilakoi_Moon was fake in a tweet July 10.

I have to let everyone know that @Lilakoi_Moon is not a real account Lisa Bonet , my sister Lilakoi Moon is NOT on Twitter . Please do not

â€” Cree Summer (@IAmCreeSummer) July 10, 2014

According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonald’s will no longer serve customers who show risks of being overweight. They will define overweight by these standards: Over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. Children’s weight restrictions will vary depending on age and height.

McDonald’s is currently running campaigns to shake its “junk food” image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from “A dining experience of fast food” to “Good food served fast.” They want people to understand the risks of being overweight.

So how will they know if you are overweight ? Will they ask you what you weigh and trust your answer? NO

They are implementing scales at the from of every register just like the one in the photo below. You must stand on the scale when ordering or you will not be served. They also plan on posting signs to let customers know that they have the legal “Right to refuse service to anyone.”

For drive-thru patrons it may be a bit more difficult to enforce. However, if the person looks like they exceed the weight restrictions, they will be refused service at the drive-thru window.","0"
"Official: Houthis take U.S. vehicles, weapons in Yemen","Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Houthi rebels took all U.S. Embassy vehicles parked at the Yemeni capital's airport and wouldn't let departing U.S. Marines take their weapons with them, a top Sanaa airport official said about the latest evidence of unrest in an Arab nation long seen as key in America's fight against terrorists.

The actions come after the United States, along with Britain, suspended operations at their embassies and moved out staffers because of the instability in Yemen.

According to the official, the Houthis seized many U.S. Marines' weapons at the airport, and the American troops also handed over some to random airport officials.

However, a senior U.S. military official told CNN the Marines disabled their weapons and gave them to a Yemeni security detail, which had escorted them to the airport, because the Marines were flying commercial.

The U.S. Marine Corps sharply denied the allegations.

""All crew served weapons were destroyed at the embassy prior to movement. None of them were 'handed over' in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan,"" the statement read.

The statement continued: ""To be clear: No Marine handed a weapon to a Houthi, or had one taken from him.""

The previous night, embassy officials burned tens of thousands of documents and destroyed weapons that were inside the Sanaa embassy's storage warehouses, Yemeni employees of the embassy said.

What you need to know about Yemen

Yemen has been an important country to the United States as the home of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the most feared, influential and operational terrorist organizations in the world. U.S. officials have had a long relationship with Yemeni leaders, working with them to target AQAP militants.

But now, Yemen's latest leader, President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, is gone, having resigned after Houthi rebels seized control of key government facilities, dissolved parliament and placed him under house arrest.

All this movement has left the Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- as the pre-eminent power in Yemen.

Their takeover hasn't been smooth and it's not clear whether it will ever be complete. There has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa.

Then there's the question of what it means for the United States and its anti-terrorism efforts.

U.S. special forces stay in Yemen

As of last month, U.S. officials hadn't engaged in talks with the Houthis, though there were discussions about whether to talk to them.

Still, even amid the turmoil, the U.S. military remains active in Yemen.

Take, for instance, the killing of senior AQAP cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari and three other people in a drone strike on their vehicle on January 31.

""They are still capable of conducting counterterrorism operations in Yemen, and frankly ... there's some counterterrorism training that's still ongoing ... with Yemeni security forces,"" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman.

""I'd be less than honest if I said that there hadn't been some adjustments already made because of the political uncertainty,"" he said. ""We're just going to have to watch this closely going forward.""

Yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against AQAP, which has been tied to the failed attempt by ""underwear bomber"" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab and Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan. More recently, the terror group has been linked to the slaughter at French magazine Charlie Hebdo.

""They are a very dangerous group,"" said Kirby. ""They do want to threaten Western interests, including U.S. interests, and we do consider them a threat to the United States of America. We're watching them very closely.""

"Yemen’s Houthi rebels seize U.S. Marines’ weapons at airport","Yemen’s Houthi rebels seized weapons from U.S. Marines as well as several vehicles used by Americans stationed at the now-closed U.S. Embassy in Sana’a.

It wasn’t immediately clear what types of weapons and vehicles were seized.

An unidentified Sana'a airport official confirmed that the rebel forces took control of the U.S. Embassy vehicles, which were parked at the airport, United Press International reported. The same official also said that the Houthi rebels seized several weapons used by U.S. Marines who were trying to abide by a White House order and leave the country.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a widely reported statement: “The Department of State has decided to suspend our embassy operations and our embassy staff have been temporarily relocated out of Sana'a. Recent unilateral actions disrupted the political transition process in Yemen, creating the risk that renewed violence would threaten Yemenis and the diplomatic community in Sana'a.”

British and French embassies have been temporarily closed, with Germany, perhaps, not far behind.

"Mexico checks if 43 missing students in mass grave","Iguala de la Independencia (Mexico) (AFP) - More bodies were being pulled out of a mass grave in southern Mexico Sunday as authorities worked to determine if 43 students who vanished after a police shooting were among the dead.

At least 15 bodies have so far been dug out of pits discovered Saturday on a hill outside the town of Iguala, 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Mexico City, two police officers at the scene told AFP.

The grim find came a week after the students disappeared when a protest turned deadly. Witnesses in Iguala say municipal police officers whisked several of the students away.

Inaky Blanco, chief prosecutor for the violence-plagued state of Guerrero, declined to say how many bodies were buried in the pits.

""We still can't talk about an exact number of bodies. We are still working at the site,"" Blanco told a news conference late Saturday in the state capital, Chilpancingo.

The site was was cordoned off and guarded by scores of troops and police.

More bodies were being recovered on Sunday, another officer said.

Juan Lopez Villanueva, an official from the National Human Rights Commission, said that six pits were found up a steep hill probably inaccessible by car.

Four forensic services vans left for the morgue late Saturday carrying nine bodies in silver bags. Authorities are conducting DNA analysis to identify the victims.

The graves were found after some of the 30 suspects detained in the case told authorities about their location, Blanco said. The detainees include 22 police officers and gang members.

If the bodies are confirmed to be those of the students, it would be one of the worst slaughters that Mexico has witnessed since the drug war intensified in 2006, leaving 80,000 people dead to date.

The students from a teacher training college disappeared last weekend after Iguala police officers shot at buses that the group had seized to return home after holding fundraising activities on September 26. Three students were killed.

Another three people died when police and suspected gang members shot at another bus carrying football players on the outskirts of town.

A survivor said in an interview that the officers took away 30 to 40 students in patrol cars.

Blanco said investigators had confirmed suspicions that a criminal organization, the Guerreros Unidos, was involved in last week's crimes and that local police officers belong to the gang.

"Are missing students in mass graves found near Iguala, Mexico?","Read this story in Spanish at CNNMexico.com

(CNN) -- Gunmen opened fire at buses carrying students and soccer players in southern Mexico.

It's been more than a week since that violent night of shootouts in Iguala, Mexico. Authorities say three students were among six people killed in the September 26 violence, and 43 students remain missing.

Where are they? Authorities and witnesses fear they may be close to unraveling the mystery.

Along a dirt road in a remote part of Mexico's Guerrero state, authorities turned up unmarked graves full of human remains on Saturday.

Investigators found the remains of at least 28 people inside the graves, Guerrero State Attorney General Iñaky Blanco Cabrera told reporters Sunday. The bodies were covered in gasoline and burned before they were buried, he said, and it could take between two weeks and two months to identify them.

A tip from suspects detained after the shootouts led them to the grave sites, authorities said.

The missing students, who were studying to become school teachers at Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, were mostly young men in their 20s, according to a website state government officials have set up to help in the search.

""Help us find them!"" the website says, offering a reward of 1 million pesos ($74,000) for information leading to the missing students.

State officials, who've faced sharp criticism over the students' disappearance, released a statement Sunday detailing their investigative efforts. So far more than 30 people have been detained, including 22 local police officers.

The police have denied attacking anyone, according to a government statement on their detention.

But protesters from the school have said officials aren't doing enough.

""NOW IT IS MORE DANGEROUS TO BE A STUDENT THAN A CRIMINAL,"" one post on a Facebook page dedicated to the school said.

Witnesses have accused police of orchestrating and participating in the shootings.

""The goal of the police was to kill any person that was inside the perimeter they had,"" one student from the school told CNN en Español.

Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre has defended his government's response and called for calm in the face of protests.

""To the family and friends of those who were savagely massacred, I offer all my solidarity and support,"" he said in a series of Twitter post Saturday. ""It would be highly condemnable, those who want to take advantage or politically profit from a situation like the one that today overwhelms and saddens us.""

A bus carrying members of the third division Chilpancingo Hornets soccer club was also among those ambushed in what authorities described as three attacks on September 26. A 15-year-old player on the team was killed.

Omar Sanchez, one of his teammates, described the ambush to CNN en Español.

""We were just watching a movie and we saw the bullets come in and then it was like we were going off a cliff and the bus tipped over. And it was then that they started firing at us with machine guns,"" he said. ""It sounded so ugly, the gunshots and my teammates screaming, 'Help, leave us alone, we are injured.' A teacher said, 'you have already blinded me, please, we are the team from Chilpancingo.""

The armed men said they weren't going anywhere, ordering the team to open the door.

""Now you are going to be taken, we are going to kill all of you,"" the gunmen said, according to Sanchez.

When the teacher refused to open the door, Sanchez said, the men opened fire again.

The case has left many troubling questions unanswered. Key among them: Who gave the orders to open fire, and what was their motive?

State prosecutors first said last week that the violence started after the college students commandeered three buses, and city police opened fire.

Since then, evidence has tied the Guerreros Unidos criminal group, and police connected with them, to the shooting and the students' disappearance, Blanco told reporters Saturday.

In 2013: 54 bodies found in mass graves in Mexico

For years Guerrero state, which includes Iguala and the well-known resort city of Acapulco, has ranked among the Mexican states with the highest homicide rates, a crime statistic regularly used by officials and analysts when discussing the overall security situation.

Figures released by Mexico's National Statistics and Geography Institute last year painted a grim picture of kidnapping throughout the country.

A survey revealed that there were more than 105,000 kidnappings nationwide in 2012, the institute said, but only about 1,300 of them were reported to authorities.

Inaky Blanco, is chief prosecutor for the violence-plagued state of Guerrero.

He told a news conference in the state capital, Chilpancingo: 'We still can't talk about an exact number of bodies. We are still working at the site.'

Reports from the scene in the community of Pueblo Viejo said at least 15 bodies were exhumed from the site.

Iguala is about 120 miles (193 km) south of Mexico City in the increasingly violent state of Guerrero, the site of clashes involving students, police and armed men last week. At least six people were killed in a spate of incidents.

Guerrero Governor Angel Aguirre said earlier this week that photos showed police had taken some of the students away.

Several hundred students protested on Saturday night in front of Aguirre's residence in the state capital of Chilpancingo, expressing anger that some of their classmates may be among the bodies found in the graves.

A car was overturned and several petrol bombs were hurled at the residence perimeter, where security outposts were lightly damaged.

Authorities found the mass grave as police are scouring the area for nearly four dozen people missing after a rash of violence. Guerrero was the site of clashes involving students, police and armed men, which started in late September

Aguirre said on Saturday that a total of 30 individuals have now been detained in connection with the incidents.

Local government officials criticized the police for showing an excessive use of force with the students in Guerrero, where gangs have evolved from a fragmented drug cartel and are fighting turf wars.

Thirteen of an original group of 57 missing people re-emerged this week. Some had hidden, others had gone home. Dozens are still unaccounted for.

Many mass graves have been found across Mexico in recent years and months, the legacy of drug gang violence that has killed around 100,000 people since 2007.

Guerrero state Health Minister Lazaro Mazon said nine bodies, burned beyond recognition, were recovered from the muddy pits in the first series of exhumations. He said it could take two weeks before identifications are made. Later, state prosecutor Inaky Blanco said 28 bodies had been recovered, in various conditions.

Frantic parents who have been demanding the return of their children attempted to reach the site of the makeshift graves, near a slum on the outskirts of the city of Iguala, about 80 miles south of Mexico City. They and supporters blocked major highways in the area for several hours.

“You took them alive, we want them returned alive,” read a huge banner unfurled across the highway that leads from Mexico City to Acapulco.

On Sept. 26-27, Iguala city police attacked a group of students rallying against government policies. Six people were killed, more than two dozen injured and more than 50 students vanished. About 15 students eventually were found hiding in their homes, but 43 remained missing. Within days, 22 police officers were arrested for what prosecutors said was use of excessive force.

Parents and surviving students have said they last saw some of the missing being taken away by police. Several parents offered up license plates of the police vehicles that took away their children.

Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre said the local police corps was thoroughly penetrated by criminal organizations, at whose behest the police may have been acting. He said that after the discovery of the graves, an additional eight people were arrested. He did not identify them.

If the graves turn out to contain the students, it will suggest that they were summarily executed by their captors, be they police or cartel criminals. And if that proves true, it would constitute the most egregious human rights atrocity in the 2-year-old government of President Enrique Peña Nieto and one of the worst in recent years.

The students were from a special kind of rural university in the town of Ayotzinapa, near Iguala. They had a contentious relationship with authorities and often spearheaded demonstrations.

After they went missing late last month, the federal government dispatched army, navy and national police to take over the search. The federal prosecutor’s office took charge of the case as soon as the graves were discovered late Saturday.

“Mexico cannot let such a serious incident go unpunished,” Tomas Zeron, head of investigations from the federal attorney general’s office, said.

"Mexico police find mass grave near site 43 students vanished","Authorities unearthed on Saturday unmarked graves containing a number of bodies on the outskirts of a southern Mexico town where 43 students disappeared after a deadly police shooting last week.

Inaky Blanco, chief prosecutor for the violence-plagued state of Guerrero, told reporters ""pits with bone remains"" had been found outside Iguala, 125 miles south of Mexico City.

""It's hard to be sure that it's the missing students because we must conduct expert tests and find similarities with the people being searched,"" a state police agent at the scene told AFP on condition of anonymity.

The graves were in rough terrain in a hillside community that is part of the Iguala municipality. Police kept reporters far from the site.

The 43 students disappeared last weekend after Iguala municipal officers shot at buses that the group had seized to return to their teacher training college near the state capital Chilpancingo.

Three students were killed. Another three people died when police and suspected gang members shot at another bus carrying football players on the outskirts of town.

Witnesses told AFP that the officers took away several students in patrol cars after the shooting. One witness said he saw 30 to 40 people taken away.

The officers are suspected of having links to criminal gangs, raising fears about the students' fate in a country where drug cartels often bury their victims in mass graves.

Around 30 bodies were found in mass graves in Iguala alone this year.

Another police official said the pits on the outskirts of Iguala were found thanks to an anonymous phone tip.

""We are very worried. The families are very anxious,"" said Vidulfo Rosales, a human rights lawyer representing relatives of the missing.

Authorities have detained 22 Iguala officers over the shootings and issued arrest warrants for the town's mayor and security chief, both of whom have disappeared.

The United Nations has urged Mexican authorities to conduct an ""effective and diligent"" search for the missing, calling the case ""one of the most terrible events of recent times.""

"Mexican investigators fear mass grave might hold 43 missing students","Security forces investigating the role of municipal police in clashes in this southern city a week ago found a mass grave on the edge of town, raising fears the pits might hold 43 students missing since the violence that also resulted in six shooting deaths.

Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre said the victims had been “savagely slaughtered.”

Jesus Lopez, the father of one of the missing students, told The Associated Press that a delegation of family and school representatives would come to Iguala on Sunday to get information about developments in the case from authorities.

“We cannot say anything. We are very nervous, but until they inform us, there is nothing,” said Lopez, whose 19-year-old son, Giovani, hasn’t been seen since the violence last weekend.

Separately, a group of students and relatives of the missing young people said they planned to march Sunday from Aytozinapa Normal school to the state capital of Chilpancingo to demand information in the case.

Anger over the discovery of the graves exploded Saturday night when a group of young people from the school protested outside the governor’s Chilpancingo residence. They threw Molotov cocktails and overturned a car after state authorities told them they would not allow them to travel to the graves to determine if the bodies are those of their missing classmates.

Guerrero State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco did not say Saturday night how many bodies were in the burial pits uncovered on a hillside on Iguala’s outskirts, and he declined to speculate about whether the dead were the missing students.

“It would be irresponsible” to jump to conclusions before tests to identify the bodies, Blanco said. Officials said the federal Attorney General’s Office and the National Human Rights Commission had sent teams of experts to aid state authorities in identifying the remains.

About 100 soldiers, marines and federal and state police on Saturday cordoned off the area where the grave site was found in the poor Pueblo Viejo district of Iguala, which is about 120 miles (200 kilometres) south of Mexico City.

Blanco said eight more people had been arrested in the case, adding to the 22 Iguala city police officers detained after a police confrontation with student protesters last weekend set off a series of violent incidents in the city.

The prosecutor has said state investigators had obtained videos showing that local police arrested an undetermined number of students after the initial clash and took them away.

He said some of the eight newly arrested people were members of an organized crime gang, adding that some of them had given key clues leading to the discovery of the mass grave.

Blanco said his investigators had found that “elements of the municipal police are part of organized crime.” He also said his office was searching for Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and had alerted officials across Mexico to be on the lookout for him.

The governor had charged earlier in the week that organized crime had infiltrated the city government.

State prosecutors have said the first bloodshed occurred when city police shot at buses that had been hijacked by protesting students from a teachers college, killing three youths and wounding 25. A few hours later, unidentified masked gunmen shot at two taxis and a bus carrying a soccer team on the main highway, killing two people on the bus and one in a taxi.

Violence is frequent in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory.

The Aytozinapa Normal school attended by the missing students, like many other schools in Mexico’s “rural teachers college” system, is known for militant and radical protests that often involve hijacking buses and delivery trucks.

In December 2011, two students from Aytozinapa died in a clash with police on the highway that leads to the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. Students had allegedly hijacked buses and blocked the road to press demands for more funding and assured jobs after graduation. Two state police officers were charged in the shootings.

During that confrontation, students apparently set fire to pumps at a gas station on the highway when federal and state police moved in to quell the protest, and a gas station employee later died of burns suffered in the attack.","0"

"McDonald’s Removing Big Mac, Apple Pies And Eliminating Large Size Options","McDonald’s Removing Big Mac, Apple Pies And Eliminating Large Size Options.

McDonald’s has just announced that it will be phasing out 8 menu items the beginning of next year and most McDonald’s customers are not happy.

With McDonald’s profits tanking over the recent months, the company has had to make some tough decisions to find adequate solutions for their financial distress by shrinking menu sizes. “Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb,” spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. “To do so we must simplify our current menu.

This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.

McDonald’s is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015.

One notable “ingredient” – preservatives – might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andrés, President of McDonald’s USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, “Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?” And then answered himself with a “We probably don’t.”

"You can still order a McPizza at these two McDonald’s locations","Over the years, countless food items have come and gone from McDonald’s finely-tuned menu, but one franchise owner in the Midwest decided that the McPizza was more than just a fad. That’s right — the McDonald’s pizza that you knew (and loved?) in the ’90s is still on the menu, but only at two U.S. locations.


FROM EARLIER: Video: McDonald’s explains that its McNuggets are really made from chicken and contain no beaks

As reported by Canada.com, one McDonald’s on the Ohio River and another in Spencer, West Virginia, both owned by Greg Mills, still serve piping hot McPizzas day in and day out.

“According to employee Judy Norman, it’s the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it’s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s,” writes Canada.com’s Ashley Csanady.

Norman tells Canada.com that there are “days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza [order].”

So if you were planning on making a cross-country road trip any time soon, it might be worth altering your route just to make sure you pass through Spencer, West Virginia on your way. After all, McDonald’s should have the pizza ready for you in under 5 minutes:","0"
"Attention children of the ’90s: you can still get McDonald’s pizza","Remember the crunch of the cornmeal crust? And the stringy cheese, with a slightly sweeter-than normal marinara underneath?

Maybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first, as was the style at the time.

In any case, if you’re a child of the nineties, you remember it well: McDonald’s pizza.



And, like pogs and Beanie Babies, it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood.

Except, in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia, where one hero owner has kept the McDonald’s pizza ovens burning all these years later.

So bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions, because I’m about to tell you where you can still buy McDonald’s pizza.


Neslted on the banks of the Ohio River, along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy, population 1,852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonald’s, located along Main Street on the riverbank, still pumps out pizza — in five minutes or less, of course.



It’s just a seven-and-a-half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic, according to Google Maps.

And, thanks to owner Greg Mills, there’s another McD’s where you can still get a slice, just over ninety kilometres away, across the state border. Spencer, West Virginia also boasts a McDonald’s that’s still lighting the pizza fires — or electrical coils, as the case may be.

According to employee Judy Norman, it’s the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it’s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. She said the location sold 13 pizzas yesterday, but there are “days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza [order].”

Mills, who it’s pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza, couldn’t not be immediately reached for comment, but this post will be updated should he return our calls.



Whatever actually happened to McDonald’s pizza, you ask?

Well, for starters, it turned out adult palates didn’t quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonald’s first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early ’90s, it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey-themed TV ads.



The market for the savoury pie topped $2 billion in the early 90s, according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonald’s pizza. And the company poured $25 million into the ovens alone across Canada, to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the-drive through took over — remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car? — and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging.

So the ovens were scrapped and McDonald’s turned its sights on other gimmicky productions — like the Arch Deluxe, which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing.","0"
"There Are Still Two McDonald’s That Serve McPizza From the ’90s","Domino's was still killing it with the Noid in the '90s when McDonald's rolled out McPizzas to get in on ""the dinnertime business."" The fast-food chain made clever signs by tipping Golden Arches sideways into serviceable Zs, and Pizza Hut's copywriters predicted, ""Every place you see a McDonald's pizza, you're going to see a war."" Formidable as all that seemed, that war never came and McPizza became a nostalgic slice for countless millennials, which is why it's insane that two locations owned by a guy along the Ohio–West Virginia border are still cranking out the ""pizza you won't believa.""



Two decades ago, the chain's ""patented"" ovens needed five and a half minutes to bake pizzas — time-consuming McPizzas were the the McWraps of their day — so most were gone by 2000. It's not clear where Greg Mills's locations in the very small towns of Pomeroy, Ohio, and Spencer, West Virginia, are getting their raw materials for the discontinued menu items, but mysteriously, they're still selling.

"Newly-Found Document Holds Eyewitness Account of Jesus Performing Miracle","Rome| An Italian expert studying a first century document written by the Roman historian Marcus Velleius Paterculus that was recently discovered in the archives of the Vatican, found what is presumed to be the first eyewitness account ever recorded of a miracle of Jesus Christ. The author describes a scene that he allegedly witnessed, in which a prophet and teacher that he names Iēsous de Nazarenus, resuscitated a stillborn boy and handed him back to his mother.

Historian and archivist Ignazio Perrucci, was hired by the Vatican authorities in 2012, to sort, analyze and classify some 6,000 ancient documents that had been uncovered in the gigantic archive vaults. He was already very excited when he noticed that the author of the text was the famous Roman historian Velleius, but he was completely stunned when he realized the nature of the content.

Professor Perrucci found the text in the archives of the Vatican, while searching amongst a bundle of personal letters and other trivial documents dating from the Roman era.

The text as a whole is a narrative of the author’s return journey from Parthia to Rome that occurred in 31 AD, recorded in a highly rhetorical style of four sheets of parchment. He describes many different episodes taking place during his trip, like a a violent sandstorm in Mesopotamia and visit to a temple in Melitta (modern day Mdina, in Malta).

The part of the text that really caught M. Perrucci’s attention is an episode taking place in the city of Sebaste (near modern day Nablus, in the West Bank). The author first describes the arrival of a great leader in the town with a group of disciples and followers, causing many of the lower class people from neighbouring villages to gather around them. According to Velleius, that great man’s name was Iēsous de Nazarenus, a Greco-Latin translation of Jesus’ Hebrew name, Yeshua haNotzri.

Upon entering town, Jesus would have visited the house of a woman named Elisheba, who had just given birth to a stillborn child. Jesus picked up the dead child and uttered a prayer in Aramaic to the heavens, which unfortunately the author describes as “immensus”, meaning incomprehensible. To the crowd’s surprise and amazement, the baby came back to life almost immediately, crying and squirming like a healthy newborn.

Marcus Velleius Paterculus, being a Roman officer of Campanian origins, seems to perceive Jesus Christ as a great doctor and miracle man, without associating him in any way to the Jewish concept of Messiah.

Many tests and analysis have been realized over the last weeks to determine the authenticity of the manuscript. The composition of the parchment and ink, the literary style and handwriting have all been carefully scrutinized and were considered to be entirely legitimate. The dating analysis also revealed that the sheepskin parchment on which the text is written, does indeed date from the 1st century of this era, more precisely from between 20-45 AD.

This new text from an author known for his reliability, brings a brand new perspective on the life of the historical character that is Jesus of Nazareth. It comes to confirm the Gospels on the facts that he was known for accomplishing miracles and that his sheer presence in a town was enough to attract crowds of people.

A complete and official translation of the document should be made available online in many different languages over the next few weeks, but the impact of the discovery is already felt in the scientific community. Many scholars have already saluted the finding as one of the greatest breakthrough ever realized in the study of the historical life of Jesus, while others have expressed doubts about the conclusions of Professor Perrucci and demand for more tests to be performed by other scientific institutions before drawing any conclusions.","0"
"NHL expansion to include Toronto, Quebec City, Seattle and Las Vegas: Report","The NHL may be set to expand in a big, big way.

Sports Business News reported late Tuesday the league is preparing to add four teams by 2017 in Toronto, Quebec City, Seattle and Las Vegas.

Expansion fees could reach a combined $1.4 billion.

The number of NHL teams would increase to 34, including nine Canadian clubs.

Earlier Tuesday, a report in the Vancouver Province, citing sources close to the situation, said an expansion team in Sin City was a “done deal” and the only thing yet to be determined is who will front the ownership group.

The report also indicated any expansion plans might include more than two teams.

In May, Las Vegas officials broke ground on the building of a 20,000-seat multi-sport arena to be completed in spring 2016.

Construction on a $400 million, 18,000-seat arena in Quebec City is underway with a projected opening date of Sept. 2015. The rink is being built as part of a public-private partnership between the city and Quebecor Media, owner of QMI Agency, Sun Media and Sun News Network.The league has routinely denied any plans for expansion in recent years.

In spite of that, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly have reportedly had several meetings with city officials and potential ownership groups in Seattle.

Bettman has in the past admitted to receiving interest from groups in Seattle, Las Vegas, Kansas City and Quebec City.

“We’re listening, and that’s all we’re doing,” Bettman said in March. “We haven’t decided to engage in a formal expansion process at this point, but we’re listening. There is a lot of interest, and some of that’s a testament to the state of the game right now.”

The league last expanded in 2000 with the addition of the Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild.","0"
"Four new NHL expansion teams? Vegas, Seattle, Toronto and Quebec by 2017: Report","There are few topics in the NHL that get people buzzing like expansion and relocation do. Drop some morsel of news in the dead of August, and it’s like tossing the last bite of a Shake Shack burger to a flock of pigeons in Central Park. 

On Tuesday, Tony Gallagher and Howard Bloom chucked their meat and the flock went crazy. Gallagher said that NHL expansion to Las Vegas was a “done deal,” and then Bloom upped the ante by claiming that the NHL will add Vegas, Seattle, a second Toronto franchise and Quebec City by 2017, the 100th anniversary of the League.

(No word on whether the League will begin an aggressive cloning program to fill out those rosters with NHL-level talent. Protect your comb, Jonathan Toews, they’re coming for DNA samples!)

Bill Daly of the NHL said the four-team expansion is ""not in"" the NHL's plans. Because what else is he supposed to say...

Gallagher of The Province wrote with finality that the NHL was coming to Las Vegas through expansion:

Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.

And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.

You know, we started getting an inkling that Bettman had changed his tune on Las Vegas when he moved one of the league’s signature promotional events there in 2009, but yes, this is a considerable about-face indeed!

So, in summary, expansion to Las Vegas is a “done deal” except for the fact that there isn’t an ownership group that’s been approved by the Board of Governors; nor is there an expansion fee established for the market that would, in theory, determine who’s willing to buy-in (oooh, Vegas parlance!).

Look, we’re all in total squee-mode for a team in Vegas. Or really any declaration that expansion is going to happen. But the proliferation of this “done deal” report – by Tony Gallagher, no less – is the most Hockey August moment in the history of Hockey August.

For the love of Balsillie, he actually writes “the only thing to be determined” is the group actually owning the team. That’s like writing, “The Penguins are going to trade for a first-line winger. They just need to find a team that will trade them one.”

Is Vegas a done deal? Of course not.

Is it likely? Connecting the dots, one could draw that conclusion.

MGM Grand and AEG aren’t building a $375 million arena to house a Carrot Top repertoire. The NHL didn’t structure its realigned conferences with 16 in the East and 14 in the West to make things easier for Winnipeg. And with the NHL pulling in record revenue, attendance and ratings, the iron hasn’t been hotter to strike for expansion.

But as we’ve noted previously about Vegas: It’s unlike any other market in professional sports. There’s unrivaled competition for entertainment dollars. Many of the people who would attend the games as local fans are working while the games are being played. The largest target audience for the team would be the casinos who fill the considerable luxury box space in the new arena and tourists who pop in to see a game while in Sin City – or, perhaps, get comp’d for one.

It wouldn’t surprise us in the least to see the NHL dive into the market, despite those mysteries, just to be first ones in and because Bettman obviously believes an association with Vegas brings some level of prestige to the League.

But what about the other three teams?

Bloom, of Sports Business News, reported later on Tuesday that the NHL was going full-on expansiongasm by adding every city that it’s considering adding for the last several years. Four new franchises, none through relocation:

“NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees”

If you’ve been following the Seattle angle, you know the situation: Chris Hansen – the billionaire, not the predator catcher – has an arena construction deal with the city that hangs on attracting an NBA team; the only hope for an NHL team there first is if Hansen has a change of heart, and Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman is working with him to that end.

Then comes the real fight: Convincing a city council that has otherwise been apathetic to hockey to turn on the funding faucet for an NHL team’s arena.

Then there’s Quebec City, which will have an NHL-ready arena next year and has no shortage of financial powerhouses ready to step up for an expansion franchise. It’s also been the most public and hubristic bid for a team, otherwise known as the opposite of how Gary Bettman likes to operate.

Then there’s a second team in Toronto, which remains the best idea out of all of these options. Then again, what media conglomerates are left to own a team there? The Score app?

And what level of bribery to the Leafs would it take to even crack that market?

Bloom believes this will happen because the NHL won’t be able to keep itself from collecting that expansion franchise windfall, and that’s as solid a theory as any. It makes sense that the League would expand quickly before losing that expansion money to another relocation (/casts an eye at Florida and Arizona).

All of this makes sense from a timing perspective and, of course, because we understand the League’s avarice. There are still significant obstacles in a couple of these markets, but it’s not outrageous to think it could happen.

Which leaves us with the biggest decisions of all: The nicknames! Seattle Sasquatch, Las Vegas Craps, Quebec Nordiques (‘natch) and Toronto Rakes (the sworn enemy of Leafs)!","0"
"NHL expansion plans in the works: reports","The NHL is considering expanding by as many as four teams, according to a pair of reports, with Toronto and Quebec City in the mix to land new franchises.

Howard Bloom of Sports Business News tweeted that the league will add four franchises ""by 2017"" in Toronto, Quebec City, Las Vegas and Seattle.

Bloom added that the NHL would take in $1.4 billion in expansion fees with the deals.

Also on Tuesday, Tony Gallagher of the Province, based in Vancouver, reported that an NHL team in Las Vegas is a ""done deal,"" according to ""sources close to the situation.""

However, French-language TVA Sports reported that NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly denied the league is looking to expand.

""It's not in our plans,"" TVA Sports quoted Daly as saying in French. ""There is absolutely nothing new on that.""

The NHL hasn't expanded since the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild joined for the 2000-01 season.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, who has previously dismissed talk of expanding beyond the league's 30 teams, visited Seattle in May for an update on a proposed new arena.

In July, former NHL great Wayne Gretzky's agent denied a report that his client is among a group of investors looking to bring a team to the city.

Toronto and Quebec City have long been considered candidates if the NHL decides to expand beyond the seven Canadian-based clubs in operation.

Quebec City hasn't had an NHL team since the Nordiques moved to Denver in 1995.

Toronto, of course, is already home to the Maple Leafs, but it's possible that Canada's most populous city could support a second team, whether in the city proper or the surrounding suburbs.

Markham, Ont., just north of Toronto, has flirted with the idea of funding the construction of an NHL-sized arena, but those plans have stalled.

Arid Las Vegas may seem like an odd place for a hockey team, but the Twitter account attributed to Panthers goalie Roberto Luongo suggested a sizable home-ice advantage could be enjoyed against weary visitors to Sin City.

""Gonna be unreal when Las Vegas goes undefeated at home every year,"" tweeted @strombone1.","0"
"Reports: NHL expansion could include Las Vegas, others","The odds of bringing a big-league franchise to the city of Las Vegas have always seemed long for a lot of reasons, but that may soon change and it might just be the NHL that brings top-level professional sports to Sin City. A recent report suggests that an NHL team coming to Las Vegas isn't so much a pipe dream as it is a certainty.

Tony Gallagher of the Vancouver Province reported that commissioner Gary Bettman, who has so often said “we're not looking to expand” or “we have no plans for expansion” so many times over the last decade, is changing his tune on expansion.

More from the Province:

…Recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when [the league will expand].

And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?

Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.

“Done deal.” Sounds almost too good to be true and it may be, but there has been movement on the expansion front recently.

UPDATE: NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly denied the report Wednesday morning in comments to TVA Sports:

""[Expansion to Las Vegas is] not in our plans, there is absolutely nothing new in that,"" he has admitted to TVASports.ca.

And if it were an organization struggling with financial difficulties, as the Florida Panthers, who moved rather in the ""Sin City""?

""We have no move in sight, whether in the case of the Panthers, or any other team besides,"" replied Daly.

Even in light of the league's denial, there's still reason to believe the NHL will have to soon expand and cities like Las Vegas and another rumored candidate Seattle would help expand the league's footprint.

Here's why it's not completely outlandish to envision Vegas as a future NHL city. For one, they have two open spots in the Western Conference to even things out and bring some competitive balance. The Eastern Conference currently has 16 teams, while the West has 14. If the NHL expanded to the most long-rumored top candidate of Seattle, that would help even things out. It's definitely not as simple as that, though.

Another barrier for Las Vegas would have been an arena, but that may no longer be an issue. The city has been home to minor-league hockey for years, but now Vegas is in the process of building a new arena however with the aim of bringing either an NHL or NBA team to Vegas.

MGM and AEG, owner of the Los Angeles Kings, are teaming up on the project that broke ground in Las Vegas in May. The new arena is due to open in 2016 and will have 20,000 seats, but a projected capacity of 17,500 for hockey. The company building the arena, ICON, is also building the Edmonton Oilers' new arena. Kings great Luc Robitaille was on hand at the ground-breaking.

There has long been a desire for Las Vegas to finally get a major league franchise and there are likely more than a few individuals out there that would be willing to bet on Sin City to support a big team.

But here are the issues that make it seem a little less likely. There are other markets like Quebec City or Southern Ontario, that have long been pushing for NHL teams and would appear safer bets than Las Vegas. Putting teams in Seattle and Las Vegas would help even out the Western conference, but there could be an uproar if the NHL goes to two more non-traditional markets while strong Canadian markets exist to make money hand over fist.

A recent report from CBC suggested that Canada could support three more NHL teams. The league undoubtedly knows that they could get a lot out of more Canadian markets and also have that new TV rights deal with Rogers, a company that would no doubt love more Canadian markets.

That's where a second report comes in regarding expansion. Howard Bloom of SportsBusinessNews.com reported that the NHL will expand by four teams including Las Vegas, Seattle, Quebec City and Toronto.

Update: In light of Daly's comments, the timeline sure doesn't seem to add up on this one, but it is hardly surprising that the league would come out in strong denial. With expansion ""not in the plans"" now, it doesn't mean it can't be eventually, and possibly soon.

A $1.4 billion figure for combined expansion fees seems a bit high. The last time the NHL expanded between 1997 and 2000, expansion fees were a reported $80 million, which was a $30 million difference from the previous high. In the 14 years since, you better believe that number is way up from $80 million. Either way, the NHL stands to gain quite the influx of cash if they can expand.

The Winnipeg Jets paid a $60 million relocation fee on top of the reported $170 million True North paid to purchase the Atlanta Thrashers. The relocation fee likely wouldn't be in the same range as an expansion fee, but it offers a more recent point of reference.

Talk of widespread expansion is a big step away from what commissioner Gary Bettman told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in June:

“Right now, we're not looking to expand. I know Las Vegas is an important city. Whether or not it's a city for the NHL to put a team in is still to be determined. We have not done any investigating as to whether or not the city could support the NHL or looked at potential ownership groups. If the owners were to approve expansion, we would certainly begin looking more closely at Las Vegas and other potential markets.”
It doesn't shut the door, but there's a lot of moving parts to expansion and you'll never hear the NHL commissioner get ahead of himself. It's clear that the gears are in motion on some level, though.

Quebec City is already building an arena that is set to be completed by 2015. The Vegas arena will be ready by 2016. Investors have interest in putting an arena in Markham, Ont., and Hamilton, Ont., has also long been a possible expansion/relocation target.

Seattle meanwhile has yet to break ground on an a new arena, but there has been some movement recently as real estate mogul Victor Coleman is adding some weight to a potential ownership group. He recently met with Chris Hansen, who is working towards bringing an NBA team to Seattle and has promised the city an arena if successful. There were reportedly talks of building the arena if the city secures an NHL team first. Coleman told KING5 News in Seattle that there is a ""clear path"" to bringing the NHL to the city.

A possible 34-team league by 2017 is a bit concerning, however. Could the international talent pool support it? It seems to be a stretch. Diluting the competition should be a major fear as there are a lot of NHL players right now that are just barely scraping by in a 30-team league. You don't have to look any further than a lot of the fourth lines in the league. Thirty-two teams may even be a stretch at that point, but adding 50 new players wouldn't be as straining as trying to add 100.

There are a lot of questions left to be answered and the fact that none of the hockey insiders that are usually on top of the big stories like this have backed up the reports yet certainly takes a little air out of these exciting developments.

Expecting the NHL to expand by 2017 without relocating current teams seems a bit overly-optimistic, but the league is making more money than it ever has and is enjoying growing popularity. More expansion is probably at its most likely since 2000 when the Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue Jackets entered the league and that offers some serious excitement for some possibly hockey-hungry markets.","0"
"Report: Toronto, Seattle, Quebec City to join Vegas in 2017 NHL expansion","Apparently Las Vegas isn't the only city on the National Hockey League's expansion team radar: Seattle, Toronto and Quebec City will add franchises as well with a target date of 2017, according to a tweet from SportsBusinessNews' Howard Bloom. 

Bloom said the four-fold expansion, which would increase the number of NHL teams to 34 and the number of Canadian team to nine, could raise $1.4 billion in expansion fees. 

A report Tuesday in Canada's The Province revealed the finalization of an NHL franchise in Las Vegas, with only the new team's ownership left to determine. The move would entitle Las Vegas to a professional sports franchise in one of the four major sports league's for the first time in the city's history. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has previously voiced disapproval of such a move out of concern over the city's potentially damaging connection to the sports betting industry.  
On Wednesday morning, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly publicly denied that anything was imminent in Las Vegas.

Seattle has been at the center of expansion rumors for more than a year and Quebec City has a new arena that is slated to open in 2015. A new team in Toronto would mean a second franchise for the city. The Maple Leafs are the NHL's highest grossing and most valuable franchise by net worth.

Oh, wait, you say there's no team in Seattle? But, but, but ... we thought it was getting a franchise this year, too.

Yeah, the crickets are still competing with all the chirping about that, about how the NHL is increasing from 30 ... to 32 ... to 34 ... or more clubs.

Gallagher wrote that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has changed his mind about expansion and is now ready to take the plunge — and that he doesn't have to stop at just two teams.

The NHL adding more than two fits historically. This is how the league has operated the past 40-plus years:

1967: Next Six, to join with the Original Six.

1970-74: Six, to continue Western expansion and to compete with the WHA.

1979: Four, as the league absorbed the surviving teams of the dying WHA.

1991-93: Five, as the Sun Belt strategy took hold.

1998-2000: Four, as part of the league's reunion tour (Atlanta, Minnesota, Ohio).

There are enough worthwhile markets outside Seattle and Las Vegas (Quebec City, Kansas City, Toronto, Hamilton, Portland) to go to 36. Also, Bettman and the owners know they can tap an easy revenue stream (aka franchise fees) if they want/need to pad their cash reserves.","0"
"Gallagher: Bettman has changed his tune on NHL expansion","It wasn’t very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he’d like an epidemic of Ebola.

But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when.

And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?

Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.

And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.

But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldn’t be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside.

A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California’s big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural?

With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing.

At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city.

And Bettman hasn’t been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot.

It’s been 15 years since the NHL expanded — and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced.

And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota.

Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork:

“There’s a lot of interest. We’re hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City,” Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games.

“We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. It’s not something we’ve seriously considered yet.”

Like hell it isn’t. They’d have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously.

And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear — one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix.

But could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True there’s a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise can’t seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all.

And while Kansas City isn’t really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they’re going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen.

Going back to Minnesota has been a success, and there’s no question there’s more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity.

There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if it’s true, after such a long wait this trivial detail — which only troubles the fans — isn’t going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this.

And any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that’s paying their salaries.

Expansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved.","0"
"Report: NHL expansion to Las Vegas 'a done deal'","The Commissioner of the National Hockey League, Gary Bettman, has repeatedly insisted that the league is not engaged in an active ""expansion process,"" but reports insisting otherwise continue to crop up.

The latest is from veteran Vancouver Province columnist Tony Gallagher, who suggested on Tuesday that the NHL will expand to Las Vegas, Nev. sooner rather than later:

Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.

Gallagher also insists that there's fire behind all of the NHL-related smoke emanating out of Seattle, Wash. and reports that Vancouver-born billionaire Victor Coleman would be among the bidders interested in bringing a second NHL club to the Pacific Northwest.

While rumors about Las Vegas expansion continue to swirl, to the consternation of players like Chicago Blackhawks nofunnick Jonathan Toews, NHL brass has been steadfast in their insistence that nothing is imminent for the league on the expansion front.

""We're not ready to expand,"" Bettman said in early May, addressing rumors of potential NHL expansion in Las Vegas. ""We, as I repeatedly have said, have received expressions of interest from people who might want to own a franchise in Las Vegas - as we have from a number of other cities - but we're not involved in any expansion process.""

In the video, obtained by Agence France-Presse, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau also denied having agreed to a ceasefire with the Nigerian government.

""Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam? They have now memorized two chapters of the Koran,"" he said.

"Continuing Violence Puts Boko Haram Ceasefire In Jeopardy","The reported ceasefire between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram, the terrorist group still holding more than 200 girls captive, does not appear to be working out, as violence over the weekend put the possibility of the girls' return on even more tenuous ground.

As Reuters reports, while the Nigeria's Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh announced the deal last Friday, it was not confirmed by Boko Haram. At least five attacks have occurred since the announcement.

From CNN:

In one attack, militants ambushed travelers in the Borno state village of Shaffa, residents of the area said, killing eight people and abducting others.

Boko Haram gunmen also stormed the village of Waga in Adamawa state, abducting a number of residents, including women, residents there told CNN.

Insurgents also occupied the town of Abadam, near Niger, after killing an unknown number of residents in their attack, residents said.

According to Reuters, negotiations between the government and the insurgency are expected to continue in Chad on Monday, but family members of those kidnapped are skeptical of whether they will be productive.

Chief of Defence Staff Air Marshal Alex Badeh told senior military officials from Nigeria and Cameroon meeting in Abuja that a ""ceasefire agreement"" had been concluded between the government and the insurgents.

""I have accordingly directed the service chiefs to ensure immediate compliance with this development,"" he added.

Badeh's announcement came after a senior aide to President Goodluck Jonathan, Hassan Tukur, told AFP that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks, as well as for the release of 219 girls held captive since April.

But a precedent of previous claims from the government and military about an end to the deadly five-year conflict and the fate of the missing teenagers left many observers urging caution.

Jonathan is also expected to declare his bid for re-election in the coming weeks, with positive news about the hostages and the violence likely to give him a political boost.

Multiple analysts cast doubt over the credibility of a man called Danladi Ahmadu, whom Tukur claimed represented Boko Haram at the two meetings in neighbouring Chad.

""I have never heard of such a man (Ahmadu) and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the group's leader Abubakar Shekau,"" said Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government.

Ralph Bello-Fadile an advisor to Nigeria's National Security Advisor (NSA), told a conference on Monday that the NSA has been inundated with fraudsters claiming to represent Shekau.

""Government wants to negotiate,"" he told a Chatham House event in Abuja, ""but so far nobody has come forward who speaks for Shekau.""

Tukur said he represented the government at two meetings with the Islamists in Chad, which were mediated by the country's President Idriss Deby.

""Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,"" said Tukur, adding that Ahmadu made the announcement on Thursday evening.

""They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,"" he continued, referring to the girls seized in northeast Nigeria on April 14, causing global outrage.

Ndjamena refused to comment but security sources in the country said Chad, which Jonathan visited for talks with Deby early last month, had been involved in the discussions.

The source also said a ceasefire agreement was reached as well as the release of 27 hostages, 10 of them Chinese nationals, who were kidnapped in northern Cameroon earlier this year.

The release of the hostages last weekend was ""a first strong signal"" from Boko Haram to prove their good faith, the source added but did not mention the schoolgirls.

- Discrepancies -

Ahmadu gave an interview broadcast on Friday on the Hausa language service of Voice of America radio in which he claimed to be the group's ""chief security officer"" and in charge of publicity.

He made no mention of an end to hostilities and was vague on details of the apparent talks, even claiming not to have met Shekau.

He also referred to the jihadi group as Boko Haram, a name that means 'Western education is forbidden' which was imposed on the Islamist radicals by outsiders. The insurgents themselves never use the term.

The group's known leaders have exclusively used the name Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, which means ""People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad"".

He made no reference to the Chibok girls and did not list the creation of an Islamic state in Nigeria's mainly Muslim north -- the core, unwavering Boko Haram demand since the uprising began.

Shekau has in a series of video messages since 2012 ruled out talks with the government and said northern Nigeria will never know peace until sharia (Islamic law) is strictly enforced.

Envoys from Nigeria's presidency have made similar ceasefire claims in the past, notably Jonathan's Minister for Special Duties Taminu Turaki, who led a so-called amnesty commission in 2013 that was tasked with brokering peace.

Turaki on several occasions maintained that he was negotiating with legitimate Boko Haram commanders, including Shekau's immediate deputies, and that a ceasefire was at hand.

But nothing materialised from Turaki's protracted negotiations. Shekau said that he never sent delegates to any talks and attacks continued at a relentless pace.","0"

"Nigeria Says Boko Haram Cease-Fire May Lead to Release of Kidnapped Girls","More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in April, sparking the #BringBackOurGirls campaign

A top military official in Nigeria was reported Friday to have announced a cease-fire between the government and the military group Boko Haram, igniting both skepticism and hopes that more than 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped in April would be released.

The truce was said to be announced by Air Marshall Alex Badeh, Nigeria’s chief of defense, the Associated Press reports. The release of the girls is still being negotiated, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade added, but the cease-fire would begin immediately and could take take several days to reach the groups of militants.

“Already, the terrorists have announced a cease-fire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a cease-fire,” said Mike Omeri, a government spokesman on Boko Haram, at a news conference. The AP adds that Omeri confirmed negotiations about the girls’ potential release were held throughout the week.

Reports of the deal were met with hesitation by those who have followed the saga since the girls were abducted from their school in Chibok on April 14. There was neither an official statement quickly released by the government, nor an announcement made by the insurgent group, the New York Times reports.

Boko Haram, which released a video in May that claimed responsibility for the girls’ abductions and vowed to “sell them on the market, by Allah,” has previously demanded the release of rebel prisoners in exchange for their freedom. But Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who has faced intense global pressure to free the students, said that’s a trade he will not make. The Nigerian government has in the past misled the public about the girls’ status; its fight against Boko Haram has been fraught with challenges since the militant group rose up in 2009, from inefficiency and corruption in the military to lax local support in the northern communities that are threatened most.

In August, the Wall Street Journal reported that American surveillance planes spotted groups that appeared to be the missing girls, suggesting that not all of them had been sold into marriage or slavery — as feared — and that some were perhaps being kept as a bargaining tactic.","0"

Boko Haram has been demanding the release of detained fighters in exchange for the girls.

The group attracted international condemnation with the April abduction of nearly 300 girls from a boarding school in northeast Chibok town. Dozens escaped but 219 remain missing.

Nigeria's president has been criticised at home and abroad for his slow response to the abducted and for his inability to quell the violence by the group, seen as the biggest security threat to Africa's biggest economy.

The group has been fighting an insurgency since 2009, with some 2,000 civilians reportedly killed this year.

Boko Haram sparked global outrage six months ago by abducting more than 200 schoolgirls.

The girls were seized in the north-eastern town of Chibok in Borno state, and their continued captivity has led to criticism of the Nigerian government's efforts to secure their release.

Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign said in a tweet on Friday: ""We are monitoring the news with huge expectations.""

'Cautiously optimistic'

Air Chief Marshal Badeh revealed the truce at the close of a three-day security meeting between Nigeria and Cameroon. He said Nigerian soldiers would comply with the agreement.

Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told BBC Focus on Africa that the agreement was sealed after a month of negotiations, mediated by Chad.

As part of the talks, a government delegation twice met representatives of the Islamist group.

Mr Tukur said Boko Haram had announced a unilateral ceasefire on Thursday and the government had responded.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" he said.

""I am cautiously optimistic.""

He said arrangements for their release would be finalised at another meeting next week in Chad's capital, Ndjamena.

The negotiations are said to have the blessing of Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, reports the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja.

Speaking to the BBC, Nigerian government spokesman Mike Omeri said Boko Haram would not be given territory under the ceasefire agreement - and that the government would not reveal what concessions it would make.

""We are inching closer to release of all groups in captivity, including the Chibok girls,"" he said.

Analysis: Will Ross, BBC News, Lagos

Nigerian officials had not given any indication that negotiations with Boko Haram were taking place. Even though there had been rumours of talks in neighbouring Chad, this is a very surprising development.

Many Nigerians are extremely sceptical about the announcement especially as there has been no definitive word from the jihadists.

The military has in the past released statements about the conflict in north-east Nigeria that have turned out to be completely at odds with the situation on the ground.

So many here will only celebrate when the violence stops and the hostages are free.

In May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan imposed a state of emergency in the northern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa, vowing to crush the Islamist insurgency.

But Boko Haram increased its attacks this year.

The group promotes a version of Islam which makes it ""haram"", or forbidden, for Muslims to take part in any political or social activity associated with Western society.

It frequently attacks schools and colleges, which it sees as a symbol of Western culture.

Human Rights Watch has reported that 2,053 civilian were killed in the first half of the year, while Amnesty International estimated that 4,000 people were killed in violence - including Nigerian military operations - in the first seven months of 2014.

Boko Haram is seeking to establish an Islamist state in Nigeria, but its fighters often cross the long and porous border with Cameroon.

Eight Cameroon soldiers and more than 100 Boko Haram militants were killed in fighting in the far north of Cameroon on Friday, Reuters quoted the country's defence ministry as saying.

The government said it would continue negotiating with Boko Haram, despite the alleged breach of the truce.

It hopes the group will this week free more than 200 girls it seized in April.

Boko Haram has not commented on the announcement made on Friday that a truce had been agreed, and that the militants would release the schoolgirls abducted from the remote north-eastern town of Chibok.

'Promise honoured'

Boko Haram is reportedly represented in the talks, taking place in neighbouring Chad, by Danladi Ahmadu.

However, Mr Ahmadu was ""bogus"" and an ""imposter"", said Ahmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist with good contacts in Boko Haram.

The abduction of the girls sparked a global campaign to pressure the government to secure their release.

Government negotiator Hassan Tukur said Boko Haram had ""honoured its first promise"" by releasing 27 Cameroonian and Chinese nationals on 11 October, after capturing them in separate raids in May and July, Nigeria's privately owned This Day newspaper reports.

""Since it delivered on its promise to Cameroon, we expect Boko Haram to deliver on the release of the Chibok girls and the cessation of hostilities in north-eastern Nigeria,"" he said.

Chad's President Idris Deby is mediating between the two sides, Nigeria's government says.

'Friend killed'

However, Saturday's attacks have caused many Nigerians to doubt whether the government has really negotiated a truce with Boko Haram, especially as no statement has been issued by its leader Abubakar Shekau, says BBC Nigeria analyst Bilkisu Babangida.

"Nigerian Claims of Boko Haram Cease-Fire Hurt by Violence","Persistent violence in northeast Nigeria is undermining the government’s claims to have brokered a cease-fire with Islamist militant group Boko Haram.

A lack of detail about the agreement the Nigerian military announced on Oct. 17 and complaints of exclusion from the process by community leaders in the worst-hit areas are fueling skepticism about prospects of an end to the five-year rebellion.

“If there is any genuine cease-fire, people from the three affected states should have been invited,” Bulama Mali Gubio, spokesman for the Borno Elders Forum, said yesterday from Maiduguri, the state capital. “But for the Federal Government just to come out and say soldiers should lay down their arms, there is a cease-fire -- it means they are giving us to Boko Haram.”

Borno, Yobe and Adamawa, states in the northeast of Nigeria, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) from the oil-producing southern coast and commercial capital Lagos, have borne the brunt of the Boko Haram insurgency.

Their populations have experienced near daily gun and bomb attacks on villages, schools, mosques and markets, and have been living under emergency rule since May 2013. President Goodluck Jonathan said last month that the rebels had killed more than 13,000 people since 2009.

‘Very Sketchy’

The agreement as announced by Chief of Defence Staff Alex Badeh “is very sketchy because nothing is spelled out,” Gubio from the Borno Elders Forum said.

As part of the cease-fire announcement, Nigerian authorities said the Islamist militant group had indicated it’s willing to discuss the release of more than 200 schoolgirls it abducted from the town of Chibok in April.

“We are aware of reports that the Nigerian authorities have agreed a truce with Boko Haram, and are making urgent enquiries to establish the facts,” the British High Commission in the capital, Abuja, said in an e-mailed response to questions today. “It is not yet clear what impact this might have on the missing Chibok girls.”

There was more fighting in Borno yesterday, as soldiers in the town of Damboa repelled an insurgent attack, leaving many dead, according to Hassan Ibrahim, leader of a pro-government vigilante group in the area.

Village Raids

“Boko Haram has yet to confirm whether it had entered into a cease-fire, and the emerging accounts of village raids and clashes with the military have raised more doubts on the credibility of the cease-fire claim,” Poole, U.K.-based security consultancy Drum Cussac said in e-mailed comments today. “There is speculation that the Federal Government may have negotiated a truce with only one faction of the sect, as violence has continued unabated in the northeast.”

The media attention the Chibok kidnap drew brought international scrutiny and criticism of Jonathan’s track record on national security. The 56-year-old president is widely expected to stand for re-election in a vote set for Feb. 14.

"Boko Haram Could Release Kidnapped Girls, Nigerian Officials Say","Protesters march in support of the girls kidnapped by members of Boko Haram in front of the Nigerian Embassy in Washington on May 6.

The Nigerian government said Friday that it reached a cease-fire agreement with Boko Haram, the jihadist organization that kidnapped 219 girls in April, according to the AFP.

“A ceasefire agreement has been concluded between the Federal Government of Nigeria and Boko Haram,” said Air Marshal Alex Badeh, Nigeria’s top military officer.

A second Nigerian official told AFP that the ceasefire would include provisions for the release of the kidnapped girls.

“They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,” said Hassan Tukur, a secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan who served as the government’s representative in talks with Boko Haram.

But some experts questioned the credibility of the officials’ claims, in part because news of the agreement comes as President Jonathan prepares to launch a re-election bid. Announcing the return of the girls, whose abduction inspired the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, could help Jonathan’s electoral aspirations — even if the claim turns out not to be entirely true.

The Nigerian government has lied about the girls several times in the past. The government even once claimed to have rescued the girls.

In particular, experts questioned the credibility of Danladi Ahmadu, who the government said was Boko Haram’s representative in the talks.

“I have never heard of Ahmadu, and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the group’s leader Abubakar Shekau,” Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government, told AFP.

"Nigeria, Boko Haram reach ceasefire deal, kidnapped girls to go free, official says","(CNN) -- Nigeria has reached a ceasefire agreement with the Islamist terror group Boko Haram that includes the release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls, Nigerian officials said Friday.

The deal came Thursday night after a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, principal secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan.

""We have agreed on the release of the Chibok schoolgirls, and we expect to conclude on that at our next meeting with the group's representative next week in Chad,"" Tukur said.

Officials provided few details about the release.

Doyin Okupe, a government spokesman, did not specify when the girls would be freed. He said not all would be let go at once, but a ""significant number"" would be released soon.

""A batch of them will be released shortly, and this will be followed by further actions from Boko Haram,"" he said. ""It is a process. ... It is not a question of hours and days.""

The Nigerian government consented to some demands by Boko Haram, but Okupe declined to provide details.

The government, he said, ""is looking beyond the girls. We want to end the insurgency in this country.""

""On the war front,"" he added, ""we can say there is peace now.""

The agreement was first reported by Agence France-Presse.

What is Boko Haram?

The terrorist group abducted an estimated 276 girls in April from a boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 are still missing.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to Tukur.

""The group has shown willingness to abide by the agreement which ‎it demonstrated with the release of the Chinese and Cameroonian hostages few days ago,"" Tukur said.

In cross-border attacks by Boko Haram this week, eight Cameroonian soldiers and 107 group members were killed in heavy fighting that lasted two days in northern Cameroon, the country's defense ministry said Friday, according to state broadcaster CRTV.

The militants led an incursion near Limani, close to the border with Nigeria, on Wednesday, equipped with heavy weapons, including at least one tank, CRTV said, citing information from the defense ministry.

The fighting lasted two hours and resumed on Thursday, when Cameroonian soldiers forced the militants back across the border into Nigeria. Seven Cameroonian soldiers were injured. A Boko Haram tank and other vehicles were destroyed and weapons and ammunition were seized by Cameroonian forces, according to CRTV.

A source involved in talks with the militants told CNN last month that Nigerian government officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross had discussions with Boko Haram about swapping imprisoned members of the group for the more than 200 schoolgirls. It is unclear, however, whether the deal includes a prisoner swap.

Where are the missing girls?

The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa.

In recent years, its attacks have intensified in an apparent show of defiance amid the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the Nigerian government.

The militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

The group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.

Boko Haram was founded 12 years ago by Mohammed Yusuf, a charismatic cleric who called for a pure Islamic state in Nigeria. Police killed him in 2009 in an incident captured on video and posted to the Internet.

"Despite ceasefire announcement, new Boko Haram attacks reported","(CNN) -- Despite government claims of a ceasefire, gunmen believed to be Boko Haram fighters attacked two villages and a town near the border with Niger, killing at least 8 and kidnapping others, residents told CNN Saturday.

Boko Haram has not yet responded to the government's announcement Thursday of a ceasefire, which an official said heralded peace in the country after some five years of conflict with the Islamic extremist group.

In one attack, militants ambushed travelers in the Borno state village of Shaffa, residents of the area said, killing eight people and abducting others.

Boko Haram gunmen also stormed the village of Waga in Adamawa state, abducting a number of residents, including women, residents there told CNN.

Insurgents also occupied the town of Abadam, near Niger, after killing an unknown number of residents in their attack, residents said.

Nigerian officials said Friday that the government had reached a ceasefire agreement with Boko Haram, which has been waging an insurgency in the country's north since 2009.

The deal, the government said, includes the release of more than 200 kidnapped girls whose abduction from their boarding school shocked the world in April.

The deal, first reported by Agence France-Presse, came Thursday night after a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, principal secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to Tukur.

""We have agreed on the release of the Chibok schoolgirls, and we expect to conclude on that at our next meeting with the group's representative next week in Chad,"" Tukur said.

Doyin Okupe, a government spokesman, said the ceasefire deal was meant not only to free the girls but also to end the insurgency.

""On the war front, we can say there is peace now,"" he said Friday.

What is Boko Haram?

A source involved in talks with the militants told CNN last month that Nigerian government officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross had discussions with Boko Haram about swapping imprisoned members of the group for the more than 200 schoolgirls. It is unclear, however, whether the deal includes a prisoner swap.

The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.

As part of its insurgency, the militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

"Boko Haram leader denies ceasefire deal, says 200 abducted girls married off ","(CNN) -- Boko Haram laughed off Nigeria's announcement of a ceasefire agreement, saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in spring have been converted to Islam and married off.

Nigerian officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the Islamist terror group.

The deal, the government said, included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping in April at a boarding school in the nation's north stunned the world.

In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials.

""Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?"" Abubakar Shekau said. ""They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.""

Shekau slammed reports of their planned release.

""We married them off. They are in their marital homes,"" he said, chuckling.

The group's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal, saying he does not represent Boko Haram.

""We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,"" he said of the negotiator.

It wasn't clear when the video was made.

Mike Omeri, coordinator of Nigeria's National Information Centre, told CNN on Saturday that all these claims contradict those made in conversations in which the Nigerian government has been involved.

Omeri said Nigeria's government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to the aide.

The ceasefire deal announced October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.

After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad.

That day passed without any signs of the girls.

Boko Haram a growing challenge

In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more ""war, striking and killing with gun.""

This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead.

Days later, members of the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria, residents said Thursday.

Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said.

For its part, the Nigerian government isn't backing down.

Rather, it is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said on Saturday.

The military claimed its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two of the states in northeastern Nigeria that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram.

Officials are ""studying"" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said.

Boko Haram, whose name translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state.

The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government.

As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

"Boko Haram ceasefire ignored as violence flares in Borno state","A ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 school girls kidnapped by the militants six months ago. That was not the case.
 
At least 25 suspected Boko Haram militants were killed as they battled with Nigerian soldiers on Monday, following a ceasefire between the Nigerian government and Islamists in the lawless northern region.
An army officer, speaking anonymously, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but that soldiers had fought them off.
""Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,"" the officer said.
Damboa, near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by a military counter-offensive.
Ceasefire 'incomplete'
The Borno Elders Forum, made up of retired Nigerian civilian and military officials from the Borno state, said attacks in recent days indicated that not all Boko Haram fighters were aware of the deal.
""I don't think they would continue attacking innocent people if they are aware and they are in agreement that there is a ceasefire,"" said spokesman Bulama Mali Gubio.
The Borno Elders Forum, which last month warned that Boko Haram was preparing preparing to take over key sites in Borno, suggested the government had not negotiated with the entire group.
""If the federal government does not know who the real Boko Haram is, I think they should come here to find out from us,"" Gubio said.
""The real Boko Haram who are killing us, who are burning our towns and villages, are not the Boko Haram that a peace deal was reached with.""
The government claimed a deal was reached after talks in Chad, which included provisions for the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped from the Borno town of Chibok in April.

"Nigeria Says It Struck A Cease-Fire With Boko Haram, But Are They Talking To The Right Guy?","Nigeria says it has struck a cease-fire deal with Boko Haram, raising hopes that over 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped by the militant group will be released. But mystery continues to surround the identity of the interlocutor on the other side of the negotiations.

Nigerian officials said the deal was reached in Chad on Friday in talks with a Saudi Arabia-based Boko Haram representative named Danladi Ahmadu.

The name took many by surprise, including people who have been involved in previous negotiations with Boko Haram. “I have failed to find anyone who has ever heard of him,” BBC’s Nigeria correspondent wrote.   “We've tried verifying the authenticity of the person from sources traditionally close to Boko Haram militants and we are getting negative feedback,” the editors of Nigerian news site Sahara Reporters told The WorldPost by email.

Ahmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist who is considered close to Boko Haram's leaders, said he does not believe Ahmadu is part of the group’s leadership or that he speaks for the group. “I challenge Danladi Ahmadu to an open debate if he has d [sic] interest of Nigeria at heart. Who is he?"" Salkida wrote on Twitter.

But Mike Omeri, the Nigerian government's spokesperson on the Boko Haram insurgency, told The WorldPost Saturday that the government is confident it has been negotiating with the right guy.

“These talks did not just happen one sunny morning ... They approached the president of Chad, and if he wasn’t confident [of Ahmadu’s identity] he wouldn’t have connected him with the president of Nigeria,” Omeri said. ""The fact that this contact comes from Nigeria’s neighbor gives us confidence.""

Chad has confirmed it is acting as a mediator in the talks to free the girls, who were kidnapped in the Nigerian village of Chibok in April. Since Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan visited Chad last month, rumors have grown that Nigeria's government was quietly negotiating the girls' release via its neighbor. It was not immediately clear how long the talks have been taking place.

Boko Haram's leadership has not commented on the cease-fire. Meanwhile, Ahmadu himself has purportedly made at least two statements in recent days. On Friday, he gave an interview with Voice of America’s Hausa-language service in which he didn’t mention the kidnapped schoolgirls and was vague on the details of the cease-fire, Agence France-Presse reported. The news agency also noted that Ahmadu referred to the militant group as Boko Haram, a name used by outsiders but not by the insurgents themselves.

On Saturday, Sahara Reporters said its correspondent in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri had obtained a CD recording of another statement by Ahamdu. This time, he was more precise.

“On the girls that we took from Chibok, all that we want before we free the girls is to get justice from the Nigerian state because there are many of our members that their business premises were destroyed, some killed and others in detention and many other oppression,” Ahmadu said, according to a translation from Hausa by Sahara Reporters. The news site’s editors said they remain skeptical about his identity.

As part of the deal, Omeri said, the talks taking place in Chad this week will address the release of the schoolgirls.

Omeri added that the militants are motivated by a wish to reintegrate into society. “They are working towards peace in order to have a chance for them to return to normal things -- for example, many have businesses, "" he said.

Asked whether Nigeria would consider releasing captured Boko Haram militants in exchange for the girls, Omeri said “every asset"" will be directed towards the girls' release. ""Everything possible is being done until the day they are freed,"" he said.

""Boko Haram want peace, they are ready for it and intend to have it implemented,"" he added.

After the cease-fire was announced, suspected Boko Haram militants continued to attack communities in northeast Nigeria, leaving several dozen dead over the weekend.

But Omeri insisted that the violence would not deter the negotiations. He suggested that militants in remote areas may not have heard about the cease-fire, or that the attacks could have been perpetrated by criminal opportunists, rather than Boko Haram members.

Boko Haram is ""deeply fractured,"" according to the risk consultancy Stratfor, quoted in Reuters Sunday. Nigeria's government had a ""difficult time identifying a Boko Haram representative who could make compromises and guarantee the entire group will observe them,"" Stratfor said.

""It is quite possible that Abuja has reached an agreement with a legitimate representative of a specific cell ... that holds the kidnapped schoolgirls captive,"" the group added.

In the kidnapped girls’ hometown, the community hardly dared to hope that the girls might be finally returned. ""We don't know how true it is until we prove it,"" said Bana Lawan, chairman of Chibok Local Government Area, told The Associated Press.","0"
"Boko Haram Cease-Fire: Abducted Nigerian Schoolgirls To Be Released, Officials Say","Boko Haram has reportedly agreed to a cease-fire with the Nigerian military as well as the release of hundreds of schoolgirls who were abducted by the terrorist group earlier this year, officials said Friday. The jihadist militia has not yet made a public statement about the decision, which could confirm the arrangement, according to the BBC.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told the BBC. ""I am cautiously optimistic."" The announcement of the release and cease-fire comes after a month of negotiations between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram, which has killed more than 2,000 civilians in 2014 alone.

The little-known al Qaeda offshoot gained national attention in April when they abducted some 300 schoolgirls from a school in Chibok, northern Nigeria, to be sold as slaves. The abduction sparked international outrage and the social media campaign #BringBackOurGirls that enlisted the likes of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and countless celebrities. Human rights organizations are watching the ongoing deals closely for any developments.

We are monitoring the news with huge expectations http://t.co/L01FrUFKwz #BringBackOurGirls

— #BringBackOurGirls (@BBOG_Nigeria) October 17, 2014

In August, Boko Haram declared an “Islamic state” in northeastern Nigeria, the Washington Post reported. Authorities believe the group is hiding the girls somewhere in that area. Jennifer Cook, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the longer the girls stay in captivity, the harder it would be to bring them home.

“With hostage situations with this many people, to bring one set back without endangering another set is very difficult,” Cooke told Time. “In some cases, there’s a pretty good idea of where they are, but extricating them from a group of armed criminals who have so little respect for life is a difficult negotiation process. And the longer they’re there, the greater likelihood they become dispersed, and the more difficult they are to track down.”

It's unclear how the girls have been treated during their captivity, raising questions about their health. “These girls are being held under absolutely horrific circumstances, subjected to sexual violence and rape, forced into servitude,” Cooke said. “There are reports that some have become pregnant.”","0"
"Kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls: Government claims ceasefire deal with Boko Haram that will bring missing girls home","Relatives of the more than 200 girls taken by militant group Boko Haram in Chibok, northern Nigeria expressed hope yesterday that a ceasefire deal said to have been signed between the Nigerian government and the Islamist group will end their nightmare and bring their families home.

However, restraint appeared to be the order of the day, with the details of any deal still hazy and no word yet from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau. Wild celebrations might have been expected at the apparent end of an ordeal that has lasted more than six months but they were not in evidence, with many cautious about what might happen. But officials have made clear that the return of the girls is part of the deal.

""We will know the negotiations were successful when we see the girls physically. And then we will know it is true. And then we will celebrate,"" said Bana Lawan, chairman of Chibok's local government, told the Associated Press.

Another resident, community leader Pogu Bitrus, told the news agency that ""people rejoiced, but with caution"".

Some reports on Friday night suggested the girls, taken from a school in Chibok back in April, could be released as early as tomorrow in neighbouring Chad – but Reuters reported yesterday, citing two senior government sources, that the Nigerian government would be looking to secure the release of the girls by Tuesday.

Yesterday Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, said the authorities are ""inching closer to the release of the Chibok girls"". He later told Reuters that ""discussions will continue in Chad next week, and on the basis of those discussions we'll have more details"" on the girls' release.

The second source quoted by Reuters said that there might need to be further meetings in Nigeria or the Chadian capital N'Djamena to iron out the rest of the details for the deal. ""We have confidence in those we are negotiating with, but we are still doing it with considerable caution. Boko Haram has grown into such an amorphous entity that any splinter group could... disown the deal,"" he reportedly said.

During its 12-year existence – the past five have seen the group trying to create an Islamic state in the north of the country – Boko Haram has been split. Doubts have been raised by some analysts about Danladi Ahmadu, the self-proclaimed ""secretary general"" of Boko Haram who was named by President Goodluck Jonathan's principal secretary, Hassan Tukur, as the Boko Haram's representative in the talks. Ahmadu gave an interview to Voice of America in which he confirmed the ceasefire that was officially announced by Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, the head of Nigeria's military forces, on Friday.

In the interview Ahmadu appeared to say that he had not even met Abubakar Shekau.

This is not the first time a ceasefire has been called, hence the trepidation on the part of families in Chibok. In July 2013, when a government minister announced an agreement, Shekau quickly denied it using a video message – his preferred means of communication. He said that whoever the government negotiated with did not speak for him, and that he would never talk to infidels.

Leaders of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, which gained the backing of politicians and public figures worldwide – including the US First Lady, Michelle Obama – summed up the mood.

""We are really cautious because there have been many times that such optimism has been expressed but did not materialise,"" Obi Ezekwesili, a former education minister said in a TV interview on Saturday. ""But all the same, we are hopeful,"" she said, according to the AFP news agency.

Quoted by the Leadership newspaper yesterday, the headteacher of the school from where the girls were taken, Asabe Kwambura, said she would be the ""happiest person in the world"" if the girls were to return

President Jonathan has faced criticism over his response to the abduction of the girls – and Boko Haram's continuing insurgency. He was set to attend a rally in Abuja yesterday where he was expected to officially announce his candidacy for presidential elections next year, leaving some to question the timing of the ceasefire announcement.

Publically, the President has also always said he would not release Boko Haram prisoners, a central demand of the group – but there has been speculation about such a deal.

Other than the girls, some of whom have escaped back to their families in the months since they were taken, many in the northern provinces where Boko Haram have killed thousands during their insurgency will be hoping the ceasefire holds. However, yesterday there were reports that suspected Boko Haram militants had killed several people in a number of attacks on Nigerian villages that occurred after the ceasefire announcement, security sources and witnesses told Reuters.","0"
"Nigeria announces truce with Boko Haram; fate of schoolgirls unclear","Nigerian officials Friday announced they had agreed to a cease-fire with Boko Haram, but their statements left confusion over the fate of 219 schoolgirls kidnapped by the militant group in April.

Defense chief of staff Alex Badeh announced the truce, saying all Nigerian military units had been instructed to abide by the accord.

Women attend a demonstration in Lagos, Nigeria, calling on the government to rescue schoolgirls kidnapped by the radical Islamist group Boko Haram.
Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, said there was also an agreement for the release of the captive girls following talks with Boko Haram representatives mediated by officials from Chad, new agencies reported.

But Nigerian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade said the schoolgirls' release was still under negotiation, the Associated Press reported.

Nigerian officials haven’t commented on what was being offered to Boko Haram in return for the girls’ freedom. The group has previously demanded the release of prisoners as a condition for freeing the hostages.

Nigeria’s military announced months ago it knew the location of the girls but said it would not launch a military operation to recover them because of the risk of casualties.

A government spokesman, Mike Omeri, told a new conference Friday that Boko Haram representatives said during negotiations that the girls were in good health.

Analysts were cautious about the news, with Nigerian officials reporting countless false dawns in its long confrontation with the militant group -- and with Nigeria facing presidential and parliamentary elections in February. Jonathan is expected to announce in coming weeks that he will run for a second term.

There have been several efforts in recent years to negotiate peace with Boko Haram, which has battled the army for control of northern Nigeria and sought to impose a strict form of Islam in the region. None of the attempts has come to anything.

Jonathan, desperately in need of some good news, has faced harsh criticism over his slow response to the girls’ abduction. His supporters accuse the #BringBackOurGirls campaign of being opposition stooges, using the girls’ fate for political mileage.

Hundreds more women and girls have been abducted by Boko Haram in recent years – and dozens of schoolboys and teachers were killed by the group that opposes secular education and other aspects of Western culture. But the mass kidnapping in April and the BringBackOurGirls hashtag coined by Nigerian activists attracted global attention to the schoolgirls’ plight.

The schoolgirls had gathered at a lightly guarded boarding school on the outskirts of the town of Chibok for their final exams when the attack happened. Gunmen loaded 276 girls into trucks and drove away. Parents and local officials accused Nigeria’s military of failing to pursue and recover the girls.

According to Nigerian officials, 57 escaped and 219 remain in custody.

Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau later released a video describing the girls as slaves and threatening to “sell them in the market.” A video of the girls reciting the Koran and dressed in Islamic clothing was also released.

Nigeria, a country of 170 million, is roughly divided between the north, which is predominantly Muslim, and the mostly Christian south.

Boko Haram emerged over a decade ago in response to Nigeria’s corrupt ruling class and opposes what it sees as the taint of Western influences such as taxation, democracy and automatic teller machines. It has become increasingly fragmented in recent years, with some factions opposed to the group’s violent attacks on Muslims.

Boko Haram’s assaults initially focused on police stations and military posts. In recent years, the group has stepped up its violence, killing thousands of people in attacks on villages, churches, schools, markets, open-air video entertainment venues, bus stations and other crowded public places.","0"
"Nigeria's missing girls 'to be released by Boko Haram', government aide claims","Nigeria’s government and Boko Haram have agreed a ceasefire that brings closer the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in the north of the country more than six months ago.

Secret meetings held between the authorities in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, and representatives of the al-Qaeda-linked militia have led to an temporary agreement to lay down arms.

Part of the deal includes “the need to rescue all the captives of the terrorists, including the students of Government Girls’ Secondary School, Chibok”, said Mike Omeri, anti-terrorism spokesman of the president’s national information centre.

There would also be an immediate ceasefire, with Boko Haram apparently saying it would suspend its bombing and kidnap campaign, and the Nigerian army agreeing not to target suspected militant camps.

“From the discussions, [Boko Haram’s representatives] indicated their desire for, and willingness to discuss and resolve all associated issues,” Mr Omeri said. “They also assured that the school girls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well.”

The announcement came days after protesters marched in Abuja to mark the six-month anniversary of the girl’s abduction. Close to 300 teenage girls were kidnapped by armed gunmen as they were driven back to their school in coaches after an excursion.

Some managed to escape, but an estimated 219 are still being held captive, reportedly in Nigeria’s neighbour, Cameroon, whose military was involved in the ceasefire talks.

There was immediate scepticism, however. One Western diplomat in Lagos, Nigeria’s coastal commercial capital, pointed out that Goodluck Jonathan, the president, is in the middle of campaigning for the presidential elections due next year.

“He’s having a tough run with Boko Haram, and he needs a boost,” the diplomat said. “It’s the main thing that people are concerned about, security. If he can score a ceasefire, great. If he can bring the girls back, even better.

“But we’ve not yet heard from Boko Haram. Until then, we’re taking this with a little salt.”

Aid groups working to secure the release of the schoolgirls welcomed the news, but also remained cautious.

“This ceasefire is incredibly promising, but we aren’t there yet,” said Hussaini Abdu, country director for ActionAid Nigeria. “Until every girl is released negotiations must continue.

“We are excited about the possibility of restoring peace in the country, but these girls must remain a priority and we therefore urge the government to ensure that the safety of all of them is guaranteed as part of any truce.”

Britain is among several nations that has offered assistance to the Nigerian government and its military to help find the missing schoolgirls.

Privately, Western security sector sources in the country report exasperation among those coming to help over the slow pace of the Nigerians’ reactions to the kidnap crisis.

The girls are understood to have been separated into several groups, making an armed rescue far more complicated and dangerous, leaving talks as the only likely route to their release.

Boko Haram has in the past insisted that it would only release the teenagers if Nigeria freed several of the group’s senior commanders, who have been captured and are in jail. There were no immediate details of what Boko Haram will get out of the ceasefire deal.

The group has been blamed for hundreds of killings in bomb or gun attacks, and it is increasingly choosing targets over an ever wider area of northern Nigeria.

It began as a local militia targeting people who broke strict Islamic regulations such as drinking alcohol. But it recently linked with al-Qaeda’s franchise in West Africa, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and appears to have taken on far more ambitious aims, including ridding northern Nigeria of Christians.

Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, frequently justifies attacks on Christians as revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigeria’s volatile “Middle Belt”, where the largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north meet.

The Telegraph revealed last month that the International Committee of the Red Cross had become involved in a secret prisoner swap deal that would ensure the schoolgirls' return.

Officials from the Geneva-based organisation sat in on talks between the Nigerian government and a senior Boko Haram leader that was being held in one of the country's maximum security prisons.

The Red Cross officials also visited a number of other jails, identifying a list of 16 senior commanders that Boko Haram wants freed in exchange for the 219 hostages kidnapped from the north-east town of Chibok.

The ICRC's role in the talks represented the first official confirmation that the Nigerian government was actively engaged in talks with Boko Haram.

Publicly, Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, has previously maintained that the government would never agree to any kind of negotiations.","0"
"Insurgents killed in Nigeria despite alleged truce with Boko Haram","At least 25 suspected Boko Haram insurgents were killed in clashes between soldiers and the Islamist militants in northeast Nigeria and five civilians were killed in fighting elsewhere in the region, a military source and residents said on Monday.

A ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the militants six months ago, and talks were due to continue in neighbouring Chad on Monday.

Boko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least six attacks over the weekend – blamed by security sources on the insurgents – that have killed several dozen people since the announcement of the ceasefire.

A government spokesman has said that the fighting on Sunday may be the work of criminal gangs in the lawless region.

An army officer, who requested anonymity, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but soldiers fought them off. “Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,” the officer said.

He said an armoured vehicle and some arms were recovered from the insurgents.

Damboa, a garrison town near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.

A member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, “Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.”

Separately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.

Tada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.

“My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,” he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.

“They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain. When the insurgents sighted our people, they pursued them and slaughtered five,” Tada said.","0"
"Nigeria says it has deal with Boko Haram to release kidnapped girls","Nigeria said on Friday it had agreed a ceasefire with Islamist militants Boko Haram and reached a deal for the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the group six months ago.

There was no immediate confirmation from the rebels, who have brought five years of havoc in Africa’s top oil producer and triggered an international outcry by seizing the girls from the northeast town of Chibok in April.

“I wish to inform this audience that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded,” said the head of Nigeria’s military, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, adding the deal had followed three days of talks with the militant sect.

Government spokesman Mike Omeri said the deal covered the release of the captives and Boko Haram had given assurances “that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well.”

Their release would be a huge boost for President Goodluck Jonathan, who faces an election next year and has been pilloried at home and abroad for his slow response to the kidnapping and his inability to quell the violence, the biggest security threat to Africa’s biggest economy.

Apart from one appearance on a Boko Haram video, the girls have not been seen since the brazen nighttime raid on the town near the Cameroon border, although police and a parent said last month that one of the victims had been released.

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as “Western education is sinful,” has killed thousands of people in its fight to create an Islamic caliphate in the vast scrubland of Nigeria’s impoverished northeast.

A senior Nigerian security source confirmed the existence of talks, but said it remained unclear whether Abuja was negotiating with self-proclaimed movement leader Abubakar Shekau, or another faction within the group.

“Commitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine. It is worth taking seriously,” the security source told Reuters.

Several rounds of negotiations have been attempted in recent years but they have never achieved a peace deal, partly because the group is believed to be deeply divided.

“There are some talks but it depends on the buy-in of the whole group. I would be surprised if Shekau had suddenly changed his mind and is ready for a ceasefire,” the source added.

The government was negotiating with Danladi Ahmadu, a man calling himself the secretary-general of Boko Haram, a presidency source said. It was not clear if Ahmadu is part of the same faction as Shekau.

Security sources in neighbouring Chad said Chadian mediators had been involved in the discussions, which were part of a larger deal that led to the release a week ago of 27 hostages, including 10 Chinese workers, kidnapped in Cameroon.

Separately, Cameroon’s defence ministry said eight soldiers and 107 Boko Haram militants had been killed in fighting in the far north on Wednesday and Thursday, a region that has suffered regular cross-border raids.","0"

“I wish to inform this audience that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded,” said the head of Nigeria’s military, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, adding the deal had followed three days of talks with the militant sect.

The U.S. State Department said it “could not independently confirm” a deal had been struck between Nigeria and Boko Haram. The United States is among several Western allies helping Nigeria’s military with training and intelligence support to tackle Boko Haram.

But French President François Hollande welcomed the “good news” and told a news conference in Paris that the girls’ release “could happen in the coming hours and days.” France has been involved in negotiations that led to the release of several of its citizens kidnapped by Boko Haram in Cameroon.

Neither Mr. Hollande nor Nigerian government officials gave any details.

Nigerian government spokesman Mike Omeri said the deal covered the release of the captives and Boko Haram had given assurances “that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well.”

But a precedent of previous government and military claims about an end to the deadly five-year conflict and the fate of the missing teenagers left many observers cautious.

Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan is expected to declare his bid for re-election in coming weeks, and positive news about the hostages and the violence would likely give him a political boost. He has been pilloried at home and abroad for his slow response to the kidnapping and his inability to quell the violence, the biggest security threat to Africa’s biggest economy.

Apart from one appearance on a Boko Haram video, the Chibok girls have not been seen since the brazen night-time raid on the town near the Cameroon border, although police and a parent said last month that one of the victims had been released.

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as “Western education is sinful,” has killed thousands of people in its fight to create an Islamic state in the vast scrubland of Nigeria’s impoverished northeast. A senior Nigerian security source confirmed the existence of talks but said it remained unclear whether Abuja was negotiating with self-proclaimed movement leader Abubakar Shekau, or another faction within the group.

“Commitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine. It is worth taking seriously,” the security source told Reuters.

Several rounds of negotiations have been attempted in recent years but they have never achieved a peace deal, partly because the group is believed to be deeply divided.

“There are some talks but it depends on the buy-in of the whole group. I would be surprised if Shekau had suddenly changed his mind and is ready for a ceasefire,” the source added.

"Boko Haram denies it has agreed ceasefire","The Islamist group Boko Haram has denied claims by Nigeria’s government that it has agreed to a ceasefire and will release more than 200 abducted schoolgirls.

The announcement came in a video sent to Agence France-Presse on Saturday in which the militant group’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, ruled out future talks with the government and said the girls had converted to Islam and been married off since being kidnapped more than six months ago.

Some 276 schoolgirls were seized from the remote north-eastern town of Chibok in Borno state in April. Many escaped in the first couple of days but 219 remain missing.

More than 500 women and girls aged from infancy to 65 have been kidnapped by Boko Haram and held in militant camps since 2009, Human Rights Watch said this week, including 60 reportedly kidnapped from two towns in north-eastern Nigeria last week. Many have been targeted because they are Christians or attending school.

Girls and women abducted by the Islamist group and later released have spoken of life in captivity that included forced marriage and labour, rape, torture, psychological abuse and coerced religious conversion.

Shekau said in the latest video that all of the Chibok schoolgirls had become Muslims. “They have now memorised two chapters of the Qur’an,” he said.

Speaking in Hausa, he said: “We have married them off. They are in their marital homes.”

Families of the Chibok schoolgirls said they were shocked but not surprised at the marriage claims.

Pogo Bitrus, the head of the Chibok Elders Forum, said: “We were sceptical about the talks to release our girls and we never took the ceasefire seriously because since the announcement, they have never stopped attacking communities. Therefore the information that our girls have been married off is not surprising to us.”

Bitrus has four nieces among the hostages. “We are only hoping the government will step up whatever efforts it is making to quell the insurgency,” he said.

Enoch Mark, a Christian pastor in Chibok whose daughter and niece are among the hostages, said the girls’ families were “lost for words”.

“Since they were kidnapped we have no certainty about the situation they are in. We keep getting conflicting information,” he said. “We only keep hoping that they will be returned to us.”

Daniel Bekele of Human Rights Watch said the Chibok kidnappings and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign had focused global attention on the vulnerability of girls in north-eastern Nigeria.

“Now the Nigerian government and its allies need to step up their efforts to put an end to these brutal abductions and provide for the medical, psychological and social needs of the women and girls who have managed to escape,” he said.","0"
"Nigeria: hopes for return of kidnapped schoolgirls rise after ceasefire reported","Questions surrounded purported deal between Nigerian government and Boko Haram for release of missing schoolgirls

The Nigerian government says it has agreed a ceasefire with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram and is negotiating for the release of 219 schoolgirls kidnapped six months ago.

The deal would mark a huge breakthrough after a five-year insurgency by extremists seeking to create an Islamic state in the north of Africa’s most populous country. It has left thousands dead and a worldwide outcry was prompted when the girls were abducted in April from the north-eastern town of Chibok.

Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign tweeted: “We are monitoring the news with huge expectations.”

But questions surrounded the purported agreement on Friday. Similar claims from the government and military have failed to bear fruit. The Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, is expected to declare that he is standing for re-election, and positive news about the hostages and insurgency could deflect criticism of his handling of the crisis.

Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, told a press conference in the capital, Abuja: “Already, the terrorists have announced a ceasefire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a ceasefire.”

Omeri claimed that there had been direct negotiations this week about the release of the missing girls. Boko Haram negotiators “assured that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well”, he said.

The truce was announced on Friday by Nigeria’s chief of defence staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, who ordered his troops to comply immediately with the agreement. Boko Haram has not made a public statement.

The group had been demanding the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls. Jonathan had said he could not countenance a prisoner swap.

The failure of Jonathan’s government to rescue the girls has prompted an international campaign and daily Bring Back Our Girls rallies in Abuja to highlight the girls’ plight. There was further anger when posters calling for Jonathan’s re-election in February by using the hashtag BringBackGoodluck2015 appeared until he ordered them to be torn down.

In July, Jonathan met for the first time parents of the girls and dozens of classmates who managed to escape. It followed months of controversy in which the parents had sought a meeting. He finally agreed to the meeting after a request from Malala Yousafzai, the 17-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by Taliban militants in 2012 and won the Nobel peace prize this month for her campaigning for girls’ right to an education.

Jonathan’s principal secretary, Hassan Tukur, told Agence France-Presse on Friday that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks, as well as a deal to release the 219 girls.

Tukur said he had represented the government at two meetings with the Islamist extremists in neighbouring Chad, mediated by that country’s president, Idriss Déby. “Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,” said Tukur. “They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,” he added.

But there was uncertainty about the identity of Boko Haram’s representative at the talks, named by Tukur as Danladi Ahmadu.

Multiple analysts cast doubt on Ahmadu’s credibility as a Boko Haram envoy. Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government, told AFP: “I have never heard of such a man, and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire, it would come from the group’s leader, Abubakar Shekau.”

Ralph Bello-Fadile, an assistant to Nigeria’s national security adviser (NSA), told a conference on Monday that it had been inundated with fraudsters claiming to represent Shekau. “Government wants to negotiate, but so far nobody has come forward who speaks for Shekau,” he told a Chatham House event in Abuja.

Ahmadu gave an interview broadcast on Friday yesterday on the Hausa language service of Voice of America radio in which he claimed to be the group’s chief security officer and in charge of publicity. He made no mention of an end to hostilities and was vague on details of the apparent talks, even claiming not to have met Shekau.

He also referred to the jihadi group as Boko Haram, a name that means “western education is forbidden”. The name was imposed on the Islamist radicals by outsiders – the insurgents themselves never use the term. Their leaders have exclusively used the name Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad, which means “People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet’s Teachings and Jihad”.

Boko Haram stormed the school in Chibok in April and snatched nearly 300 students, of whom 219 remain in captivity. This week about 50 protesters in red shirts tried to march to the presidential villa but were repeatedly diverted by riot police. The president has blamed activists for politicising the abductions and influencing the parents.","0"
"Reports: Boko Haram may release schoolgirls as part of deal","More than 200 missing schoolgirls kidnapped by the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram may be released as part of an immediate cease-fire agreement announced Friday with the Nigerian government, according to multiple media reports.

Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told BBC Focus on Africa that the cease-fire agreement came after months of negotiations mediated by Chad.

The girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram — the group's nickname means ""education is sinful"" — on April 15 while in school in the northeastern town of Chibok.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" Tukur told the BBC. ""I am cautiously optimistic.""

"Boko Haram denies truce, says kidnapped girls married","ABUJA, Nigeria — The leader of Nigeria's Islamist extremist group dashed hopes for the release of 200 kidnapped girls Saturday, denying reports of a truce with the government.

In a new video message, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau says the schoolgirls have converted to Islam and married off. ""The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,"" he says, laughing.

The news goes counter to what the Nigerian government said nearly two weeks ago when it announced a cease-fire deal with the terrorist organization, raising hopes among the families of the kidnapped girls — who were taken from the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok in April — that their daughters would soon be released.

But as the weeks dragged on with no sign of the kidnapped girls, hopes began to fade.

""I was very excited when I heard the news — I will finally reunite with my daughter,"" said Hamidah Amira, 36, whose 17-year-old daughter was kidnapped. But then desperation set in, especially as Boko Haram abducted dozens of young women and teenagers in northeast Nigeria and continued to launch attacks that forced hundreds to flee.

Despite those incidents, the government insisted negotiations with the Islamists were ongoing in Chad, as some began to raise doubts a cease-fire was even agreed upon by the group.

Martin Ewi, senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies' office in Pretoria, said he didn't think Boko Haram had agreed to a truce, citing the lack of public statements on the issue in the past two weeks.

""The government might be talking to one faction … and then you have the other factions which might not have bought into the idea of dialogue,"" he said.

Human Rights Watch estimates Boko Haram, whose name loosely translates as ""Western education is forbidden,"" has abducted around 500 young women over the past five years.

Although some girls managed to escape from the Islamists, the whereabouts and the fate of the rest of the young women are uncertain.

A recent Human Rights Watch report, based on interviews with victims and witnesses of Boko Haram abductions, offers rare insight into a series of physical and sexual abuses the girls suffer in captivity, including rape, forced labor and beating.

""We found that the Nigerian government has never interviewed these girls, never really found out or learned what they've gone through, never attempted to do any kind of investigations,"" said Rona Peligal, Human Rights Watch deputy director for the Africa Division. ""They were kind of left on their own.""

Chibok resident Solomon Ali is deeply critical of the government's handling of the situation since the beginning.

""We were disappointed that the government has done nothing to ensure these girls are released,"" he said, adding officials have failed to keep the community informed.

Outraged by the kidnappings and the atrocities committed by Boko Haram, the international community has urged the Nigerian government to step up its efforts to free the girls. Since April, a campaign under the motto ""Bring Back Our Girls"" went viral on social media.

Peligal says Nigerian authorities should do a better job responding to the Boko Haram threat and ensuring protection around schools.

""The government needs to better anticipate and plan for those kinds of abductions because they're continuing,"" she said. ""And the government should respond capably.""

Ewi worries the girls would not be freed unless the government yields to Boko Haram's demands to release some of their militants.

""You can't pursue military operations and still be hoping to release the girls alive,"" he said.

Analysts warn the situation is likely to get worse in the months ahead of the 2015 election. Earlier this week, President Goodluck Jonathan, who is under increasing scrutiny for his failure to locate the girls, confirmed he would be running for re-election.

""The Boko Haram issue has been indeed politicized, and I expect it would be further politicized as we get closer to the election,"" said Peligal.

In the meantime, Amira — like other moms — waits, while making a personal appeal to Boko Haram to release her daughter and the other girls.

""They should sympathize with us, not with the government,"" Amira said.

"Six months after abducting Nigerian schoolgirls, Boko Haram reportedly wants to free them","On Friday, the Nigerian military reportedly agreed to a truce with the militant group Boko Haram. According to the announcement, more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls who were abducted this year will be freed. According to CNN, the details of the release are expected to be negotiated next week.

In August, the militant group Boko Haram declared an ""Islamic state"" in northeastern Nigeria, a territory largely occupied by the fighters. Boko Haram is believed to be hiding the girls somewhere in this area.

This week marked six months since the mass kidnapping took place. Here's what has happened since.

On April 14, 276 Nigerian girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants from a school in Chibok, northern Nigeria, according to official figures. The mass abduction occurred at night, and it took days before the full scale of the kidnapping became clear. Shortly after the abductions, a military spokesperson claimed that most of the girls had been rescued by Nigerian soldiers, but the remarks turned out to be wrong. Whether or not the Nigerian army is suited to finding the girls has been questioned: Its reputation in the rural north is bad, and it is often accused of lacking transparency and its soldiers of committing crimes. One recent video allegedly showed Nigerian soldiers slitting prisoners' throats, according to Amnesty International.

In the weeks following the mass kidnapping, criticism of the Nigerian government and the military had quickly grown as they failed to free the girls. In May, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau released a video message claiming that the girls would ""remain slaves with us.""

Nearly 200 days have passed since the girls were abducted, and according to estimates, more than 200 schoolgirls are still being held by Boko Haram militants.

Only a few dozen girls have managed to escape over the past months: The Times of London cited an example of four girls who were able to flee from their captors and walked for three weeks through the jungle. Most of the escapes, however, took place shortly after the abductions, as this graph shows. As time passed, hope faded for many parents, and reports of escapes became less frequent. ""The longer they're there, the greater likelihood they become dispersed, and the more difficult they are to track down,"" Jennifer Cook, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Time magazine this week, before the reports emerged that Boko Haram was considering freeing them. There are conflicting numbers of how many girls are still in captivity — some say 215, some say 219.

The numbers used in our graph only refer to the mass kidnapping in April. Other abductions of women and girls have occurred since.

Boko Haram is predominantly active in the northeast of Nigeria, where the girls were kidnapped, but its sphere of influence extends further into the west and south of the country.

The militants have conducted an increasing number of attacks over the past few months and are now believed to be active in an area which could be up to 500,000 square kilometers, or 193,000 square miles. Its core area spreads over as much as 250,000 square kilometers, roughly the size of the United Kingdom. However, Boko Haram is not in full control of most of the areas in which it is active.

Fatalities from non-criminal Nigerian violence — a term that includes attacks by terror groups and communal or political actors — have risen rapidly since 2010, and Boko Haram attacks are the main driver behind this rise. The militant group has killed at least 5,100 Nigerians this year, according to estimates of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. This graph shows how fatalities caused by Boko Haram went up from around zero to more than 5,000 annually within only six years.

Although the threat posed by Boko Haram had grown steadily, it took until the April abductions for the conflict to make international headlines. The burst of reporting was accompanied by a huge rise in attention to Boko Haram on social media.

Up until May 13, about 3.3 million tweets were posted, using the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. According to the BBC, most people who used the hashtag lived in Nigeria (27 percent) and the United States (26 percent). Still, thousands of tweets are being posted each week in an effort to raise awareness about the fate of the Nigerian schoolgirls.

The social media campaign found prominent supporters: As of Oct. 17, more than 57,000 users had retweeted Michelle Obama's message: ""Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families. It's time to #BringBackOurGirls.""

The Obama administration deployed 80 U.S. military personnel to Chad in May. In a letter, the White House said: ""These personnel will support the operation of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft for missions over northern Nigeria and the surrounding area,"" and aid in the search for the missing schoolgirls. Chad is east of Nigeria. Other countries, such as China, France and Britain, have also sent military assistance to the region.

According to some reports, Boko Haram started to sell some of the kidnapped girls as brides to militants in May. The value of a girl, according to Boko Haram: $12. The Associated Press cited reports of forced mass weddings which had taken place after the abductions. In a video message, Boko Haram leader Shekau had reportedly announced: ""I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah.""

The hunt for Boko Haram leader Shekau had started well before the mass abductions of the girls. In 2013, the U.S. State Department added Shekau to its ""Rewards for Justice Program,"" offering up to $7 million for information that led to his capture. Those efforts have been unsuccessful. A video which was released this month showed Shekau alive and in freedom.

Meanwhile, USAID — the international development agency of the United States — has devoted about $150 million to programs aimed at providing education to Nigerian children and teenagers.

The programs primarily target internally displaced children and others who are affected by the violence in Nigeria. Only 28 percent of primary-age children have ever attended school in Borno, the state in which the kidnappings took place.

The low attendance rates in an area partially under the sphere of influence of Boko Haram does not seem to be a coincidence. Boko Haram's name can be translated as ""Western education is sin.""","0"
"North Dakota Names Landfill After Obama","The state of North Dakota has named a new publicly-owned landfill after President Barack Obama.

In an overwhelming 35-10 vote, the state Senate advanced a bill naming a 650-acre site currently under construction after the nation’s 44th president. Governor Jack Dalrymple is expected to sign the measure into law Tuesday.

When completed, the Barack Obama Memorial Landfill will be the largest waste disposal site in North Dakota, and the 17th largest in the United States. It will be especially rich in toxic waste from the local petroleum and medical industries.

“We wanted to do something to honor the president,” says Republican State Senator Doug Perlman, who was the lead sponsor of the bill. “And I think a pile of garbage is a fitting tribute to Obama’s presidency.

“We originally planned on naming it after a nearby mountain. But then someone jokingly suggested we name it after Obama. I never thought and idea like that would actually pass. But I was pleasantly surprised.”

The president is hardly popular in North Dakota. The most recent poll in December 2013 found that Obama has a 35% approval rating in the state, although that figure may have fallen further in the year since. Yet even considering the political climate, seasoned observers are surprised that two Democratic lawmakers voted for the bill’s passage.

“I supported Obama because I thought he would end the wars in the Middle East;” says Allison Mitchell, a progressive Democrat from Grand Forks. “But he decided to fight new wars abroad instead of fighting for single-payer health care and jobs here at home.

“I guess people expected me to oppose this landfill thing because I’m a Democrat. But honestly I don’t really care anymore. Maybe this small act of protest will wake him up.”

Ordinary citizens in the state also seem to approve of the government’s choice.

“I can’t think of a better name,” says Joe Blough, a plumber from Minot. “It’s darkly colored and it's full of shit. That pretty much sums up Obama.”","0"
"Is Kim Jong-Un Really Opening a Restaurant in Scotland?","If the past few weeks of nonstop media onslaught about North Korea and The Interview just haven’t quite appeased your insatiable appetite for Kim Jong-Un antics, fear not—there are other things (literally) cooking up his tunic sleeves.

Everyone’s favorite guilty pleasure, the sometimes-reliable, sometimes-not UK rag The Daily Mail, reports that the dictator is eyeing Scotland as the location for his next business venture—an expansion of the restaurant chain known as Pyongyang, which is owned by the North Korean government and used to generate additional cash flow overseas. There are currently franchises in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Kuala Lampur, Jakarta, and more recently, Amsterdam.

Although the proposed new location may seem a bit random, Scotland has allegedly been singled out for two reasons. The first is that Kim Jong-Un and other elite North Korean officials love drinking Scotch whisky. (His father, the late Kim Jong-Il, was a bigger fan of Hennessy, supposedly spending some £700,000 a year on the cognac.)

In September of this year when the United Kingdom debated whether or not Scotland should be granted sovereignty, Kim Jong-Un was allegedly a supporter of the country’s independence because—as Choe Kwan-il, managing editor of North Korean paper Choson Sinbo, told UK’s Daily Mirror—“North Korea is rich in natural resources and we like the taste of Scotch whisky, so [Scotland and North Korea] can be beneficial to each other.”

In terms of the potential new addition to the Pyongyang chain, The Daily Mail claims that the other reason why North Korea might single out Scotland is that they want to make nice with some European countries in hopes of improving diplomacy and their global image. North Korean Leadership Watch editor Michael Madden tells the Mail that Kim Jong-Un has been trying to think of ways to buddy up with Scotland ever since its bid for sovereignty, and has more hope for acceptance there than in those other judgy European countries like England and France. Madden also claims that tourists in North Korea are already encouraged to pay tips in Scotch rather than won (the local currency).

Jenny Town of the US-Korea Institute is also quoted as arguing, “North Korea is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy, as North Korea itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation.” In this case, that may mean trying to snuggle up with a Pyongyang franchise that will attempt to win over the Scots via dishes such as barbecued cuttlefish, kimchi, pine-nut gruel, dog meat soup, and a mysterious aphrodisiac made out of bears. (Although these foods are served at other Pyongyang restaurants, there is no specific evidence that they’d make their way onto menus in Scotland).

There has been no official announcement from North Korea confirming that they are opening a restaurant in Scotland—in fact, a Korean embassy official recently denied the story to The Independent. But as it is with many other wealth-generating businesses in North Korea, many critics believe that cash flow from the restaurant chain goes straight to Jong-Un himself and his small group of elites with virtually no trickle-down to the North Korean people.

Kim Jong-Un, 31, gained quite a bit of attention earlier this year for his diagnosis of gout, a disease commonly caused by overindulgence in rich, fatty foods. It was widely reported that he became ill and developed a limp and facial swelling because he had become literally addicted to Emmental, more commonly called “Swiss cheese.”

No other details about the new restaurant have yet to be verified, so it’s unclear whether tipping in whisky would be encouraged.","0"
"Could Kim Jong Un open a restaurant in Scotland?","North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un could be opening a restaurant in Scotland and serving national favorites such as dog on the menu, experts said.

""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite's thoughts,"" Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, told the Edinburgh Evening News.

""Despite voting 'No' they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

The report comes just months after Scots voted to remain part of the U.K. in an independence referendum. North Korea backed the calls for Scottish Independence, and the historic moment could be behind the controversial leader's potential move to locate his next ""Pyongyang"" restaurant branch in Scotland.

The North Korean embassy in London declined to comment. The Scottish government said it was looking into the report.

The regime – which has been accused of severe human rights abuses by the United Nations – opened the first branches of Pyongyang near the border with China in the 1990s. Kim Jong Un's restaurant expansion plans saw a branch open in Amsterdam in 2012. This eventually closed down but reopened under the name of Haedanghwa.

Pyongyang restaurants are known for being a lavish and expensive experience. Traditional Korean music and entertainment often takes place. Jim Hoare, a Korea expert at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, has visited the restaurants in Asia. He said the main aim of them is to raise money and up the profile of the regime abroad.

North Korea has been seen as notoriously closed to the outside world and its reputation took at further battering at the end of last year when U.S. officials blamed Kim Jong Un's regime for the unprecedented hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment.

The move into Scotland could be to drum up support for North Korea, but despite Kim Jong Un's love of cheese and whisky, Hoare was surprised by the choice of location.

""Scottish food is very conservative and the idea of them taking to Korean food…I can't think it is the obvious place to go,"" Hoard said.

""This type of restaurant is not aimed at the Korean community but aimed at rich foreigners who might want to spend money, and may be more suited to London.""","0"

Experts say that Kim is especially keen on opening the restaurant in Scotland due to his love of whisky and its popularity among the communist ruling elite.

The 'Pyongyang' chain of restaurants already has branches in China and Asia, with proceeds from the business being funnelled back into North Korea to help prop up the secretive regime.

Michael Madden, editor of North Korea Leadership Watch, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those with left-wing leanings.

He explained: 'It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

Mr Madden, a frequent visitor to North Korea, added: 'They are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

'They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run.'

She added: 'North Korea is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy, as North Korea itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation.'

The state-run food outlets - which began springing up about 10 years ago - channel up to 30 per cent of takings back to Pyongyang.

But some critics fear the cash ends up in Jong-Un’s own pockets to fund his lifestyle.

As well as a love for whisky, the North Korean leader is reportedly hooked on Swiss cheese.

It’s claimed he imports vast quantities at huge expense - despite millions of his countrymen being malnourished.

A unhealthy appetite for Emmental is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning so much that he now walks with a limp.

"Is North Korea, world's most secret state, really planning a new restaurant in Scotland?","WATCHERS of North Korea's secretive regime believe it could be planning another surprise move, a restaurant in Scotland.

The Cambodia eaterie
Leader Kim Jong-Un has already opened a diner in Amsterdam, with the 'Pyongyang' chain of restaurants also having branches in China and parts of Asia.

It has been reported that the dictator is believed to be interested in opening another in the UK, with claims by observers of North Korea that Kim is especially keen on an eaterie in Scotland.

His fondness of whisky and the profile of Scotland's referendum have been cited as key reasons for the potential serving of North Korean delicacies such as dog meat soup and pine-nut gruel in Scotland.

Proceeds from the 'Pyongyang' chain are funnelled back into North Korean government funds.

Michael Madden, editor of North Korea Leadership Watch, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those with left-wing leanings.

He said: ""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean's elite's thoughts.

""Despite voting no they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable than England, plus North Koreans love whisky.

""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland,"" Edinburgh Evening News quoted Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, as saying. He further explained that North Koreans consider Scotland, which leans more towards leftist ideals than England, more suitable to ""deal with"".
Moreover, the North Korean leader is said to have been keenly interested in Scottish affairs during the Referendum Debate of September 2014, wherein voters decided ""yes"" or ""no"" on ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"".
""Plus, North Koreans love whisky,"" said Madden, before elaborating, ""Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency"". The restaurants, if they did open, would serve all nationally popular delicacies, giving the Scots a chance to experience North Korea, without actually going there. 
The dictator already owns over a chain of restaurants ""Pyongyang"", with international branches including one in Amsterdam. Although the possibility is quite intriguing, an official at the North Korean Embassy in the United Kingdom is said to have denied any such plans.

Kim Jong-un could try and open a restaurant in Scotland serving delicacies such as dog meat soup, North Korea experts claim.

This comes after the controversial leader brought his chain, The 'Pyongyang' restaurants, over to Europe by launching one in Holland.

Now North Korea watchers believe Scotland may be the next prime location, largely thanks to the popularity of whisky among the communist ruling elite.

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch, said Jong-un is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

Mr Madden, a frequent visitor to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, said: ""They are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

"SNOWDEN: ‘Elf On A Shelf’ Actually Hugely Successful NSA Project  Read more: http://www.duffelblog.com/2014/12/elf-on-a-shelf-snowden/#ixzz3MAOziZJf","STOCKHOLM — Speaking via Google Hangout to officials in Sweden last week, former NSA Contractor Edward Snowden dropped a bag of coal on his former employers by revealing the hugely popular “Elf on a Shelf” trend is actually an intelligence gathering operation originating with and run by the National Security Agency.

“It actually started out as a joke,” Snowden said in his speech. “Someone photocopied a picture of an elf with the caption ‘I’m watching you,’ and it just kept moving from cubicle to cubicle.”

Snowden said that at some point it occurred to someone that if people as paranoid as NSA staff would play this game, what would happen with civilians?

“Now, the NSA has an agent inside practically every home with a child in it,” Snowden said.

“The elves have basic mobility, which isn’t a problem because when one shows up someplace unexpected,” Snowden added, “it’s just assumed to be part of the game.”

Through these adorable snoops, the NSA has gained access to millions of tax returns, bank statements, and 10-year old boys unwrapping and re-wrapping their presents in the days ahead of Christmas.

“We would flag those kids for later recruitment to the intelligence community,” Snowden said. “Especially for Tailored Access Operations.”

In addition, the NSA has uncovered a trove of data about the personal lives of millions of Americans, sources confirmed.

“The NSA has incorporated advanced sensors into these things that can uncover all kinds of information,” journalist Glenn Greenwald told Duffel Blog in an email.  “They can tell things about people’s health — cancer, heart disease, liver disease. They know who’s being naughty, and who’s being really naughty, things that even extensive online snooping couldn’t provide. Dildos, vibrators, chains — all the things stashed in closets and under beds.”

Sources told reporters these were previously inaccessible to the government’s leading intelligence agency, if the owners paid cash at least.

“If you want to know why the ‘privacy advocates’ have settled down, and moved on? My guess is, blackmail. These elves have accumulated petabytes of evidence against pretty much everybody,” Snowden said.

“You wouldn’t believe what perverse things people will do to each other, right in front of these things,” Snowden concluded. “It’s why ‘ElfMonitor’ is such a highly sought after duty assignment.”","0"
"Oil Futures Jump on Rumored Pipeline Explosion in Saudi Arabia","NEW YORK—Oil prices jumped Wednesday on unconfirmed rumors in the market that a pipeline exploded in Saudi Arabia, raising fears that the country’s crude production and exports could be curtailed.

A spokesperson for Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s oil company, told The Wall Street Journal that the company has seen the rumors, which circulated on Twitter, but isn’t able to confirm them.

Prices have been sliding for months on concerns that the market is oversupplied and that Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil exporter, is unlikely to cut production to raise prices.

Light, sweet oil for December delivery recently traded up $1.84, or 2.4%, to $79.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Brent, the global benchmark, rose $1.52, or 1.8%, to $84.34 on ICE Futures Europe. Earlier in the session, prices were trading lower around $82.50 a barrel.

Weekly inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which showed a smaller-than-expected increase in U.S. crude supplies, also supported prices.

December gasoline futures recently rose 2.1% to $2.1211 a gallon. December diesel rose 1.5% to $2.4793 a gallon.

"U.S., Brent crude jump on rumor of oil pipeline blast in Saudi Arabia","Nov 5 (Reuters) - U.S. and Brent crude futures extended gains on Wednesday on an unconfirmed market rumor of an oil pipeline explosion in Saudi Arabia.

Oil futures had already been lifted by a government report showing a smaller-than-expected rise in U.S. crude stocks and drops in gasoline and distillate inventories.

Brent December crude futures were up $1.60 at $84.42 a barrel at 11:02 a.m. EST (1602 GMT), after jumping to $84.45. U.S. December crude was up $2 at $79.19 a barrel, having reached $79.35. (Reporting by Robert Gibbons; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)","0"

"Oil spikes on U.S. inventory data, Saudi explosion rumor","Oil futures extended gains Wednesday on unconfirmed rumors of an oil pipeline explosion in Saudi Arabia after previously spiking on data that showed U.S. crude inventories rose less than expected.

U.S. crude stocks increased by 460,000 barrels in the last week, data from the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday. Analysts had expected a rise of 2.2 million barrels.

Brent turned positive, popping 61 cents to $83.43 a barrel shortly after the report was released. It previously reached a low of $81.63 for the day, its weakest level since late 2010.

U.S. crude rose $1.37 to $78.56 a barrel, rebounding off a low of $75.84 hit in the previous session, its weakest since October 2011.

Earlier on Wednesday weak economic data from top energy consumer China intensified worries about demand as a global supply glut grows.

Services sector growth in China weakened in October as new business cooled, a private survey showed, coming just days after data revealed sluggish factory growth in the world's second-largest economy.

""Supply is higher and demand expectations are being cut almost every day,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam.

Brazil's oil output reached a record 2.358 million barrels per day in September, up nearly 13 percent from a year earlier, national oil regulator ANP said on Tuesday.

Consistent supply from Libya and Iraq, where many expected production to be disrupted by conflict, has added to the downward pressure on prices.

Van Cleef added that dollar strength was weighing on oil. Oil, priced in dollars, becomes more expensive to holders of other currencies when the U.S. currency rises, denting demand.

The dollar index hit a new 4-1/2-year high on Wednesday.

Oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic lost more than 2 percent on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia cut export prices to the United States, threatening to deepen a global supply glut that has driven crude prices down 30 percent since June.

A bleak outlook for Europe after the European Commission downgraded its forecast for euro zone economic growth over the next few years also weighed on oil prices.

Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi is making his first visits in years to fellow exporters Venezuela and Mexico, although tumbling oil prices are not the stated purpose of the trip, according to officials and sources.

Still, the travel plans come at a pivotal moment for Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets later in November to discuss how to respond to the rout in global oil prices.

"Loggers Accidentally Cut Down World’s Oldest Tree in Amazon Forest","The giant Samauma tree that is thought to be over 5,800 years old judging on its concentric rings and estimated to be close to 40 meters in height was a major part of the native tribes cultural landscape, countless generations of natives having witnessed the long duration of the tree and having included it in their own culture.

«It is the Mother spirit of the rainforest, from this spirit-tree came the life force of all things living. They have destroyed Aotlcp-Awak, they have brought darkness upon not only our people, but the whole world» explains local tribesman leader Tahuactep of the Matsés tribe.

Native communities alarmed local media outlets and conservation groups when Aotlcp-Awak, or Mother tree in local dialects, was reported sawed down by heavy machinery

Anna Golding, local researcher for non profit organization and conservancy group Rainforest Protection Coalition (RPC), an initiative stemming from Berkeley University in California, believes the ‘incident’ was intentionnal. « There are large portions of this national reserve that are rich in oil and natural gas. There has been committed action by energy corporations to lobby the government to exploit the area for years. The protected zones have been cut in half over the past decade and this is only their latest attempt to get rid of the local populations who are fighting to preserve their cultural heritage and lifestyle» she admits.

"Whoa, Paul Rudd Was One of the Airport Heroes Who Took Down the Homophobe","You remember the video we posted about late Friday? When I put that item up, the video had a little more than 10,000 views. Now it’s got more than 1.7 million.

Well, turns out that one of the onlookers who rushed to the defense of the man attacked by an antigay bigot at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport was Paul Rudd. The actor. You know, this guy. He was probably on a connecting flight from Kansas City.","0"
"Did Paul Rudd Help Tackle That Dallas Airport Gay-Basher?","On Saturday, the entire Internet watched in horror and then cautious joy as a drunk and/or high man in the Dallas-Forth Worth airport assaulted a random bystander he believed was gay. The attacker was then quickly subdued by a crowd of people. The video, first posted by Raw Story, has been viewed nearly two million times. But only one person, comedian and friend of Jezebel Sarah Benincasa, noticed that one of the guys tackling said gay-basher looks a lot like actor and decent-seeming human being Paul Rudd.

Here's the video once again, via Raw Story:



As you can see, the glassy-eyed gentleman attacks the guy in the pink shirt because he suspects him of being ""a queer"" and then, when asked why he did that, screams ""Because America!"" (It's great that a crowd of people worked to subdue him; slightly less great that an airport security guard can be seen meandering past him moments before he attacks the pink-shirted man, ignoring him as he screams threats and takes his sweatshirt off.)

In her viewing of the video, Benincasa noticed that around 1:30, one of the people dog-piling the man really, really looks like Paul Rudd. Like, a lot:

As Wonkette reported, another Twitter user, @msigs, found a girl who'd tweeted about seeing Paul Rudd that day, and got her to confirm he was wearing what he had on the video: a checked shirt and a sport coat.


However, that Twitter user appears to have seen Rudd on a flight out of Savannah, Georgia, and we don't know for sure that he stopped in Dallas. (Do people with Paul Rudd-level money really have layovers?)

So, the jury is still out on this one, even as the glorious #PaulRuddSavesLives hashtag is engulfing Twitter. But, if confirmed, it's going to be almost as great — and, let's be frank, arousing — as that time Ryan Gosling broke up a street fight.

This is even better than the time Ryan Gosling Hey Girled Laurie Penny from getting hit by a lorrie!

So here is a thing, about this, for blogging. When we saw the video alllll the way back on Saturday, we said, “that is nice when men choose to be manly by physically — and at risk to themselves — keeping the peace. But we are guessing everyone here is bored and also on the lookout for troublemakers and terrorists. Call us when they stop a gaybashing in front of the Crowing Cock.” But we did not say it out loud.

Well! Now that Paul Rudd is involved — which we know thanks to Sara Benincasa and also this dude @msigs — we are going to guess that FUCK YEAH they would have stopped that nonsense in the streets too, because we give Paul Rudd more credit than random Dallas cowboys, because we are regionist and also classist and probably racist too, the end.

"Watch Two Guys Appear to Get Tricked Into Catcalling Their Own Moms","Now, that is an awkward dinner conversation

A filmmaker in Peru seems to have come up with an ingenious solution to men sexually harassing women in the street — trick serial offenders into catcalling their own mothers.

Two moms are shown agreeing to be secretly filmed as they donned flattering disguises and strolled past their unwitting sons. After the men shout out sleazy comments, the women pull off their wigs and confront their red-faced boys with a very loud and very public rebuke.

One enraged mother is seen hitting her son over the head with her handbag.

The clip, created by American clothing brand Everlast, was filmed in Peru’s national capital Lima, where the company says 7 out of 10 women report being harassed in the street.","0"

"These Men Freak Out When They Discover The Women They Are Harassing Are Their Moms In Disguise (VIDEO)","Street harassment is something that happens to women all over the globe. It may begin to occur a lot less in Lima, Peru after an extremely creative Public Service Announcement, which was sponsored by Everlast aired. The video shows what happens when men harass an attractive woman in the street, only to soon find out that the woman is in fact their own mother in disguise. The results are nothing short of hilarious. The video is called Harassing Your Mother.

The host of the video starts out by saying:

“7 out of 10 women are sexually harassed on the streets of Lima, Peru. Men who do it think it is a minor offense. Let’s show them that they are wrong.”

They find “repeating offenders” who harass women on the streets, then proceed to get in contact with their mothers. The moms then get a makeover that makes then look fabulous and not immediately recognizable.

The first man in the video calls out to a woman that he does not know is actually his mother saying (at least according to the translation):


 
“Tasty panties!”

The mother then turns around and walks up to her son. The realization that he just catcalled his own mother dawns on him as he says, “Mama?”

She then wails on him. She says:

“What’s the matter with you Renzo? What they told me about you is true.”

The man then tries to desperately rationalize the awful thing he did to his mother telling her that it is, “just a game.”

They repeat the prank again one more time in the video, just to cement the idea they are trying to put out. Remember, the next woman you decide to harass on the street may turn out to be your mother, so maybe try not to do it. Okay?

"The men caught cat-calling and wolf whistling their own MOTHERS: Hilarious TV show disguises women so they can experience their sons' behaviour","A new TV show in Peru has captured the moment unwitting men have been caught wolf-whistling their own mothers.

The experiment took two mothers, whose sons were identified as repeat cat-callers, and disguised them using make-up, wigs and clothes. The women then women walked past their sons to gauge their reaction.

The mother wearing a disguise of a wig and sunglasses walks past her unsuspecting son and a friend, before he makes a comment towards her

The mother then goes over to confront her child, who is still unaware the woman is actually his parent

The man acts in horror as he realises it is his own mother and she launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty

The mother gets so angry with her son, she then takes off her bag and proceeds to hit him with it due to this behaviour

In the first case, the mother is dressed in a short black dress and walks past her son and a friend in the street.

The son then unwittingly makes a comment at his mother saying 'tasty panties' which prompts her to go and confront him.

She then removes her sunglasses and the man then realises he has just cat-called his own mother.

The mother then launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty and saying she never taught him to talk to women in that manner.

Another mother, wearing a black wig walks past her son, who is standing working on the streets of Lima

After making a remark towards his mother, she then turns around and goes over to confront him

She then takes off her wig to reveal herself and then throws it on the floor in anger after being disgusted by her son's behaviour

The mother then tells her son he should be ashamed of himself for speaking to her like that, as he pleads with her to calm down

She then gets so angry with her child that she then removes her bag and hits him with it.

Meanwhile in the second case, the mother wearing a green dress, walks past her son, who calls her 'piggy'.

She then calls his name before taking off her wig and confronting her son, hitting him with her hairpiece.

The man then tries to claim he didn't make the remark but is then forced to apologise to his mother before she walks off

She too launches into a tirade telling her son to he should be ashamed of himself, while he pleads with his mother to quieten down as he is working.

He then tries to claim he didn't make the remark and it a man in a nearby car, but he eventually apologises before his mother walks off.

The video ends with a warning saying men should start respecting women before they unwittingly harass their own mothers.

A new PSA about street harassment shows what happens when men realize the women they're catcalling are actually their mothers. Sponsored by Everlast, the PSA takes place in Lima, Peru where, as the video states, seven out of 10 women are harassed on the streets. Everlast found two men who were ""repeat offenders"" and contacted their moms who agreed to dress in disguise and walk past their sons.

The outcome is highly satisfying. After their sons yell some fairly unsavory things, the horrified moms publicly berate them. One of the women actually repeatedly hits her son over the head with her purse after he calls her ""Tasty panties."" It's everything you've ever wanted a catcaller to hear.

"These Men Catcalling Their Undercover Mothers Is the Best Payback Ever","Like most other places with people, Lima, Peru has a surplus of men who pass those crucial moments throughout their work day by sexually harassing women in the streets.

Everlast, the brand you had no clue was this fierce, actually did something about it.

They filmed men catcalling their own mothers. Everlast tracked down the mothers of their very scummy spawn and got them on board for a worthwhile mission: shame your son by getting him to accidentally catcall you. Everlast gave these moms makeovers, wigs, manicures, the whole thing. Then they sent these women out all dressed up like all the other desperate women who wear dresses out in public so that they could be magnets for pervy lines like “where are you going, can I come?”

Predictably, this video shows the sons saying dirty stuff to their own mothers in disguise, but it doesn’t stop there. In the typically charming way we’re all so enchanted with, one dude calls his own mom “piggy.” Another says, “tasty panties!” That’s when the most satisfying part happens. The mothers turn around for the reveal and bitch these men out. So this is one chance encounter with a lady in the street they won’t forget. The glorious leader of this effort, who is wearing fingerless Everlast driving gloves, wants the moms to slap these scoundrels, but watching them freak out is even more gratifying. Even if it isn’t real, it’s required viewing for all men with female relatives.

It could have been trite to have moms help their sons see the light by subjecting them to street harassment. It might have been corny if Everlast gave these dudes a chance to redeem themselves. But these boss women offered no such opportunity. They were on a war path to make their sons pay. In one screaming session, they express all the anger you’ve felt every time you had to deal with sex invites in the morning.

It’s a pretty genius way to turn the tables on the catcallers. At least it’s definitely more effective than issuing a friendly card explaining why it’s not polite to express interest in a stranger’s underwear. One of the guy’s explains to his mommy that it wasn’t him saying those nasty things. (It was the guy in the car.) Iron-clad alibis like this are best handled by a raging mother in heels. Freud may have already died, but now he’s literally dying over this.

But a statement purporting to be from her UAE family has 'disowned' her

It attacks her for 'taking part in the brutal aggression against Syria'

The female air force pilot whose missions against Isis were dubbed 'boobs on the ground' has reportedly been disowned by her family and labelled an 'ingrate'.

Mariam Al Mansouri's participation in F-16 bombing raids for the UAE was celebrated in the West, but an anonymous statement claiming to be from her family 'disowned' her for 'taking part in the brutal international aggression' against Syria.

It also expressed support for the Islamic State, saying 'we are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant'. The brutal terrorist group's original name was the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or Isil.

'We hereby remind the Muslim nation all over the world of its duty to defend the causes of the nation [meaning the Islamic nation], and we urge them to take up the jihad [holy war] for the sake of God to support the blessed Syrian revolution against the descendants of Ibn Al Alqami.' [Sunni Islamist insurgents refer to the Shi'a as 'alqami' - a reference to Mu'ayyad al-Din Muhammad Ibn al-Alqami, a Shi'ite minister in the last Abbasid caliphate, who purportedly assisted the Mongols in conquering Baghdad in 1258.]

'We call upon all factions and battalions operating on the Syrian battleground to unite and join efforts and forces towards the single objective of overthrowing the monstrous Assad regime perched on the pure and blessed Syrian land.

'Al Mansouri family, in the UAE and abroad, takes this opportunity to declare its support for the blessed Syrian revolution and to all free men defending their rights everywhere in the world.

'Our family is proud of all free men who defend their cause and of all those who take up arms to defend the honour of their nation [The Islamic Nation}. We are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant and all those who take up the banner of righteousness wherever they may be. We may not know them, but God knows them and would champion them.

'We ask our countrymen not to burden us with the consequences of the actions of the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri. All the honourable members of our family have agreed to this statement.

'Al Mansouri family.'

The statement also expressed support for the Syrian revolution, according to the Palestinian Wattan news agency.

It said: 'We the Mansouri family in the United Arab Emirates hereby publicly declare that we disown the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri as well as anyone taking part in the brutal international aggression against the brotherly Syrian people, starting with our ingrate daughter Mariam Al Mansouri.

'We ask our countrymen not to burden us with the consequences of the actions of the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri.'

It continued: 'We call upon all factions... on the Syrian battleground to unite and join efforts and forces towards the single objective of overthrowing the monstrous Assad regime.

'Our family is proud of all free men who defend their cause and of all those who take up arms to defend the honour of their nation [the Islamic Nation]. We are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant and all those who take up the banner of righteousness wherever they may be.'

It's not clear whether the views expressed in the statement represent those of the entire family or indeed if it is genuine.

The Mansouri tribe has some influential members, including the country's economics minister, but it's also very large – the second biggest in Abu Dhabi, the capital of UAE, so it certainly can't be assumed that the views expressed in the statement are representative of the whole group.

The statement could well have been made anonymously out of fear of punishment, as voicing dissent against the UAE government can result in imprisonment.

If true, the statement won't represent the first time the Mansouri family has been linked to extremism.

In January this year high-profile lawyer Mohammed al-Mansoori was jailed for allegedly trying to set up an 'international' branch of the controversial Muslim Brotherhood in the UAE, according to the BBC.

Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. She joined it in 2007 and is now a squadron commander.

She is one of eight children and has a degree in English literature.

The UAE is known to have the most liberal views on women's rights in the Middle East and Mansouri said that she was treated as an equal by her commanding officers.

She told Deraa Al Watan magazine: 'Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence.'

She says that her nearest relatives are supportive of her role in the air force.

There was also no difference between men and women with regards to training and assignments, she said.

'Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence,'

Earlier this week Fox News host Eric Bolling apologised for calling Major Mansouri's missions as 'boobs on the ground'.

A Fox News host has issued an apology after making a sexist comment about a female fighter pilot earlier this week on The Five.

During a segment about Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri, a female pilot from the United Arab Emirates who led a mission this week against ISIS in Syria, Eric Bolling referred to her mission as 'boobs on the ground.'

Now, after outrage from viewers, and even his own wife, following these insensitive remarks, he has apologized.

'I made a joke and when I got home, I got the look, and realized some people didn't think it was funny at all,' Bolling said on the air today.

'I said sorry to my wife and I apologize to all of you as well and want to make that very clear.'

This all began when Bolling's cohost, Kimberly Guilfoyle, praised Maj. Mansouri on the program Wednesday afternoon.

'Hey ISIS, you were bombed by a woman,' Guilfoyle said.

'Oh yeah, hell came down on ISIS in Syria, because guess what: the first female pilot piloting for the [United Arab Emirates], there she was, leading the strikes. Dropped the bombs on ISIS Monday night.'

Maj. Mansouri, 35, was the first woman to join the Emirati Air Force.

'This is really incredible,' Guilfoyle continued.

'Major Mariam Al Mansouri is who did this. Remarkable, very excited. I wish it was an American pilot. I'll take a woman doing this any day to them.

Right after she said this, the men on the panel began making sexist jokes.

It comes as Britain, Belgium and Denmark on Friday joined the U.S.-led coalition of nations that are launching airstrikes on Isis.

The European politicians flatly described the moves as critical to security on home soil, arguing that facing down terrorists has become a matter of urgency.

Prime Minister David Cameron made a passionate plea for action in drastic terms - noting that the militants had beheaded their victims, gouged out eyes and carried out crucifixions to promote goals 'from the Dark Ages.'

'This is about psychopathic terrorists that are trying to kill us and we do have to realize that, whether we like it or not, they have already declared war on us,' he said. 'There isn't a `walk on by' option.

There isn't an option of just hoping this will go away.'

Cameron told a tense House of Commons during more than six hours of debate that the hallmarks of the campaign would be 'patience and persistence, not shock and awe' - a reference to the phrase associated with the invasion of Iraq.

That unpopular intervention has cast a shadow over the discussions because critics fear that Europe will be drawn into a wider conflict, specifically taking on the Islamic group's fighters in Syria.

British MPs voted 524-43 for action after being urgently recalled from a recess. Belgian lawmakers also overwhelmingly approved, voting 114-2 to take part, despite widespread concerns that more terrorism may follow in their homeland as a result.

The White House said in a statement that it welcomed the countries to the coalition.

'These decisions - along with those by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar to participate in airstrikes against ISIL in Syria - demonstrate the clear commitment of the international community to take action together against these terrorists,' the statement reads.","0"
"NASA: Planetary Alignment On Jan 4, 2015 Will Decrease Gravity For 5 Minutes Causing Partial Weightlessness???","via Daily Buzz Live

Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you might experience on January 4, 2015 if this story is true.

According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.

Who is going to try this??   Cause I most definately am! 2 weeks from today folks!","0"

Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95° wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earth’s crust is maximum even at their closest approach.

But don’t get too excited. If you think you’ll be able to float around your house, you’re wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.

"Mechanical polar bear ‘threatened with ASBO for singing Christmas songs’","If Asbos weren’t out of control before, they could be now, after a six foot mechanical polar bear was allegedly threatened with one.

Bernard the polar bear has stood outside The Loft Café, in Shefford, Bedfordshire, since December 1 and has delighted children with his Christmas inspired singing and dancing.

But staff at the cafe were left stunned on Monday when they got a visit from local council officers.

Owners Rob and Teresa Farndon were told there had been complaints of a noise nuisance and they needed to investigate Bernard’s racket.

Cafe worker Abbie McGee, 19, argued the bear was there for the whole of last December without any complaints but that didn’t seem to make a difference.

‘The children love him and there’s even one woman who used to put 20p in his pocket every time she went past,’ she said.

‘I can’t believe there have been complaints, is no-one allowed to have fun anymore?

Central Bedfordshire Council confirmed they had visited the premises ‘on a number of occasions’ and Bernard was subject to an ‘ongoing investigation’.

"NEWS/ All Dogs Go to Heaven! Pope Francis Confirms Paradise Is Open to All of God's Creatures","Finally, Pope Francis confirms what we've always known: All dogs go to heaven!
During his weekly address in St. Peter's Square, the Catholic leader tried to console a little boy who was heartbroken over the death of his beloved pup. According to multiple reports, Pope Francis told the boy, ""One day, we will see our animals again the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God's creatures.""
Of course, this viewpoint goes against the conservative Catholic ideology that because animals don't have souls (!), they can't go to heaven. Some theologians have cautioned, per the New York Times, that Pope Francis ""had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.""

Others within the faith, however, took the pontiff's words for what they were. ""He said paradise is open to all creatures,"" Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit persist and editor at large of America, the Catholic Magazine, told the Times. ""That sounds pretty clear to me.""
It's pretty clear, too, that Pope Francis is a friend to the four-legged. In fact, he took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

In it, he wrote about an encounter with ""an old woman whose only fear is that she may never be reunited with her animals after death because some people say animals have no soul.""
Dr. Herriot held the old woman's hand and told her reassuringly, ""If having a soul means being able to feel love and loyalty and gratitude, then animals are better off than a lot of humans. You've nothing to worry about there.""

"Do all dogs go to heaven? Pope tells grieving boy: 'Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures'","Is there a pet door on the Pearly Gates?

During his weekly address in St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis comforted a young boy who was distraught over the recent death of his dog by telling him, ""One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ,"" the 77-year leader of the Roman Catholic Church said, according to Time. ""Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures.""

The statement by the pope was welcomed by animal rights groups and humane societies across the globe, who see it as a repudiation of traditional Catholic teaching dating back hundreds of years that holds that animals can’t go to heaven because they have no souls.

""My inbox got flooded,"" Christine Gutleben, senior director of faith outreach at the Humane Society, the largest animal protection group in the United States, told the New York Times. ""Almost immediately, everybody was talking about it.""

Some Catholic scholars, however, have warned that the Pope’s comment was made casually and should not be taken as official Church doctrine. Others point to earlier comments that seem to suggest that Pope Francis has long held beliefs that animals can go to heaven.

""He said paradise is open to all creatures,"" Father James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large of  the Catholic magazine America, told the Times. ""That sounds pretty clear to me.""

The statement has also stirred up debate between vegan groups and their counterparts in the meat industry – with groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) saying the pope’s statement aligns with the view of heaven as a peaceful place and could convince more Catholics to avoid eating meat.

""It’s a vegan world, life over death and peace between species,"" said Sarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA. ""I’m not a Catholic historian, but PETA’s motto is that animals aren’t ours, and Christians agree. Animals aren’t ours, they’re God’s.""

Pope Francis’ statement worried many in the multi-billion dollar meat industry, for whom the idea of Catholics not buying meat – especially those holiday hams and turkeys in the lead up to Christmas – equals a potentially large loss of revenue.

""As on quite a few other things Pope Francis has said, his recent comments on all animals going to heaven have been misinterpreted,"" Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, told the Times in an email. ""They certainly do not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin.” 

Mr. Warner quoted passages from Genesis that say man is given “dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on earth.""

“One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ,” said the leader of the Catholic Church, according to Italian news sources. 

This is a significant pivot from the position held by Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. In 2008, he said that when an animal dies, it “just means the end of existence on Earth.”

Francis has consistently made headlines with sometimes controversial remarks since assuming the papacy in 2013.

Vatican observers have called him a ""radical"" because of his open-mindedness and desire to reach out to ""the grassroots of Catholic life.""

The 77-year-old leader of the world's one billion Roman Catholics has adopted more liberal positions than his predecessor, stirring up tensions with conservative Catholics on issues such as homosexuality and single motherhood. 

In one such instance in July 2013, Francis struck a compassionate tone when speaking about homosexuality. 

""If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?"" he said to reporters on a flight returning to the Vatican from Brazil.

"Dogs DO go to heaven… and cats, and horses: Pope assures young boy that there is a place in paradise for animals as well","The leader of the Catholic Church has assured pet lovers across the world that dogs do go to heaven.

Speaking at his weekly address in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis confirmed that there is a place in heaven for our furry friends, along with 'all of God's creatures.'

The head of the Catholic Church had been attempting to console a distraught young boy who was mourning the death of his dog, according to Time magazine.

Pope Francis confirmed that there is a place in heaven for dogs and 'all of God's creatures' during his weekly address in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square

The statement is at odds with conservative Roman Catholic theology which states that animals cannot go to heaven because they have no souls.

Francis was quoted by Italian news media as saying: 'One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God's creatures.'

The remarks have been warmly welcomed by animal rights groups such as PETA and the Humane Society.

The issue of whether animals have the chance of an afterlife has been debated for centuries.

Pope Francis has refused to meet the Dalai Lama over fears it could impact on the Catholic Church's relationship with China.

The exiled Tibetan leader requested the meeting during a visit to Rome but it was declined 'for obvious reasons concerning the delicate situation' with China.

The Catholic Church in China is divided in two; the official Church overseen by the Chinese Communist Party, and an underground community that swears allegiance to the Pope.

But the main bone of contention is over which side should have the final say in the appointment of bishops.

A Vatican official said the Pope's decision was 'not taken out of fear but to avoid any suffering by those who have already suffered'.

The longest serving Pope - Pius IX - who was the leader of the church from 1846 to 1878 believed animals had no consciousness and therefore could not have an afterlife.

Pope Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, had also denied the idea of pets entering heaven and said their death simply meant the end of their existence on Earth

But it is perhaps unsurprising that Pope Francis, aged 77, supports the idea of pets and animals having a place in paradise as he took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

It's not the first time Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who took over from Pope Benedict XVI last year, has courted controversy.

"Pope says dogs can go to heaven: ‘Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures’","In an effort to console a grieving boy after the death of his beloved pup, Pope Francis declared that ‘all of God’s creatures’ have a shot of ending up in heaven when they die. New York dog owners and animal lovers everywhere rejoiced at the good news.

Delighted city dog owners agreed Friday with Pope Francis’ comforting comment to a distraught boy that the lad’s recently departed canine would be welcome in the hereafter.

“That’s great!” said fashion designer Allina Liu as her pet pooch, Snoopy, hit the Union Square dog run. “All dogs go to heaven, right? There is no hell for dogs.

“There is hell for people who treat their dogs badly. People who treat their animals poorly just shouldn’t have them.”

The Pope, speaking earlier this week, offered his assurance of four-legged angels to the grieving child.

""Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,"" he said during the weekly papal address.

“This marvelous plan cannot but involve everything that surrounds us and came from the heart and mind of God,” the pontiff said.

The Pope’s stance was also hailed by animal-rights activists. Though his dog dogma appeared unexpected, there had been earlier clues to the Pope’s feelings about the animal kingdom. He took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

Francis’ puppy views reverse opinions from previous popes, who maintained that heaven was just for human believers.

In a 2008 sermon, Pope Benedict XVI explained that not all creatures “are called to eternity” and when non-humans die, their deaths mean “solely the end of existence on earth.” The move seemingly barred pets from paradise.

Francis did not say if dogs could go to hell, too.

The puppy pardon is the latest move in his apparent campaign to make the Catholic church more inclusive and tolerant.

Earlier this year, he said gay men and women had “gifts” to offer the church, a dramatic shift in tone from the Vatican’s traditional anti-gay views. He also softened the church’s condemnation of premarital sex, cohabitation and divorce.

Health care worker Sarah Gluck, 26, said she was not religious, but definitely approved the Pope’s words.

“Dogs are a reflection of their owners; 99% of dogs go to heaven. But there’s always that 1%.”

Gluck said it’s too soon to know if her 4-month-old Australian shepherd will find eternal salvation.

“It’s hard to tell right now if Lilly is going to heaven because she’s so young,” said Gluck. “But if she goes to hell, it’ll be my fault.”

Dog walker Donna Bruno, 32, brought beagle-bulldog Hailey and Wheaten terrier Emma to the park with her.

She didn’t see how things could get any better for her canine charges.

“All dogs go to heaven?” Bruno asked as she watched the pair carouse happily with their equally excited pals.

“They’re already in heaven. Look at these guys,” she said.

But asked if the remarks had caused a new debate on whether animals have souls, suffer and go to heaven, Camosy said, “In a word: Absolutely.”
To some extent, it was not a surprise that Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals, would suggest to a saddened child that his lost pet had a place in the afterlife.

‘I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman,’ he said.

With his new outlook, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston is yet to confirm if Father O’neal will be permitted to resume preaching in his former parish in South Boston or not.

Father John Micheal O’neal, who was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital on Thursday, January 29, 2015, was revived through the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, which kept the blood flowing to his brain as doctors managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm, after a major heart attack.

"Catholic priest dies for 48 mins, wakes up claiming God is a woman","A 71-yr-old Catholic priest, John Micheal O’neal has claimed that God is a woman, with a warm and with a comforting motherly figure.
John Micheal O’neal from Massachussetts was said to have been declared dead for more than 48 minutes, he was miraculously revived by medics and had woken up with a shocking revelation that he had gone to heaven and met God.
Reports say Father O'neal was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.
But with the aid of high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.
It was gathered that doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.
The elderly priest claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.
He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.
“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”
It was learnt that declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

"Etats-Unis: Mort pendant 48 minutes, un prêtre affirme que Dieu est une femme","Et si Dieu était une femme? C'est ce qu'affirme le père John Micheal O’neal, prêtre de 71 ans dans le Massachusetts. Le 29 janvier dernier, il est amené d’urgence à l’hôpital, victime d'une crise cardiaque. Quelques minutes après son arrivée, il est déclaré cliniquement mort. Les médecins parviennent finalement à le «ramener à la vie en redémarrant son cœur, 48 minutes après qu’il s’est arrêté, rapportent plusieurs médias américains.
Le religieux américain a prétendu avoir des souvenirs clairs de ce qui lui était arrivé pendant ces longues minutes de mort clinique. Il explique avoir eu la sensation d’être sorti de son corps, entouré par une lumière écrasante, et éprouvé un sentiment d’intense amour autour de lui. Des sensations souvent évoquées par ceux qui ont fait l’expérience de mort imminente (EMI).  
Dieu, une «figure maternelle chaleureuse et réconfortante»
Mais John Micheal O’neal va plus loin. Il affirme être monté au ciel et avoir rencontré le Tout-puissant. Celui-ci serait un «être de lumière», mais surtout, une «figure maternelle chaleureuse et réconfortante».
«Sa présence était à la fois immense et réconfortante», déclare le prêtre catholique. «Elle avait une voix douce et apaisante et sa présence était aussi rassurante que l'étreinte d'une mère. Le fait que Dieu soit une Sainte=Mère au lieu d'un Saint-Père ne me dérange pas, elle est tout ce que j'espérais et même plus encore».
Ces déclarations ont provoqué l’émoi dans le clergé catholique de l'archidiocèse, obligeant le cardinal Sean P. O’Malley  à faire une déclaration publique, pour expliquer que Dieu n’était pas une femme et que le père O’neal avait subi des hallucinations.","0"
"Catholic Priest Dead For 48 Minutes, Is Miraculously Revived – His Revelations About God Are Even More Shocking","A Catholic priest from Massachusetts had been dead for 48 minutes before he was miraculously resuscitated. However, it is his description about God that is bound to spark a hot debate about the almighty.

Father John Michael O’Neal was officially declared dead for more than 48 minutes, but medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. According to the 71-year-old man of God, the supreme entity isn’t a man, as is popularly assumed and believed. Father O’Neal claims he met God during the brief time he was officially dead and God is a woman.

The catholic father claims God is a warm and comforting motherly figure. The revelation will undoubtedly have a profound bearing on the teachings of Christianity, which firmly believes and even implies that God is a male figure who has watched over us with love and devotion. Though the love and devotion part is corroborated by Father O’Neal, he differs from the church’s teachings about the gender of God.

Father John Micheal O’neal had the chance to meet with the divine when he was rushed to a hospital late last month owing to a massive heart attack. However, Father O’Neal was declared clinically dead shortly after his arrival. Not one to give up hope so easily, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital kept the blood flowing to his brain with the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2.

While the blood flowed with the help of modern science, doctors worked tirelessly to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm. Consistent with near-death experiences, Father O’Neal entered heaven through a gate made of bright light and encountered God. However, instead of the all-mighty father figure, the priest claims he was warmly greeted by a motherly figure. Father O’Neal describes the divine entity as “mother-like ‘Being of Light.'”

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting. She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

As expected, the priest’s claims about the gender of God has created quite a stir amidst devote Catholics. The intense discussion between the catholic clergy of the archdiocese about the “experience” of the father and the ramifications of his revelations persuaded the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

Though his superiors have disapproved, Father O’Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother.”

“I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

Given the potency of Father O’Neal’s alleged experience, it is quite likely he might face some resistance and criticism. However, he is prepared, assures the priest.

"Joan Rivers' doctor denies 'unauthorized procedure,' selfie before cardiac arrest","(CNN) -- Joan Rivers' personal throat doctor denies ""performing an unauthorized procedure"" before the comedian suffered cardiac arrest, a source close to the doctor told CNN.

Dr. Gwen Korovin also ""categorically denies"" taking a selfie photo while Rivers was under anesthesia at a medical clinic, the same source said Thursday.

The statement disputes what a source close to the Rivers death investigation told CNN -- that staff members at the clinic told investigators Korovin snapped the selfie and also performed an unauthorized procedure on Rivers.

Rivers, 81, died a week after suffering cardiac arrest during an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic.

CNN's source close to the investigaton also provided new details Thursday, including that a sedated Rivers was visible in Korovin's procedure room selfie.

Clinic workers told investigators they heard Korovin make a statement to the effect that Rivers ""will think this is funny"" or ""would love this"" as she took the photo, the source said.

Investigators do not have access to the phone Korovin used to take the photo, the source said.

The source also provided more specific information about what procedures were done on Rivers.

Several clinic workers told investigators that it began with Korovin performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds.

Gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was the medical director of the clinic until resigning in the wake of Rivers' death, then performed an endoscopy intended to diagnose why she was suffering a sore and hoarse throat, the source said.

Cohen detected something of concern, the source said..

Korovin then began a second laryngoscopy to again view River's vocal cords, the source said. It was at that time that her vocal cords began to swell, leading to a cut off of oxygen to her lungs and ultimately to cardiac arrest, according to the source.

Rivers was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later.

Korovin was only authorized to observe Cohen, who performed the procedure since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source said.

Investigators have found no prior consent form signed by Rivers authorizing a procedure by Korovin, the source said. It was unclear if Rivers had given verbal consent to the biopsy before being sedated.

Korovin is well known for helping an impressive list of celebrities with voice trouble. The list of famous patients who have sung her praises include actors Hugh Jackman and Nathan Lane and singers Celine Dion, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande.

The walls of Korovin's Manhattan medical office are covered with autograph photos, including from operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Broadway star Barbara Cook and actress-singer Julie Andrews.

""I've always been fascinated by the human voice and music,"" Korovin, 55, is quoted telling the New York Daily News in a profile story last year.

Korovin's lawyer sent a statement to CNN Thursday in response to the reports:

""Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

""As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient.

""For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.""

The clinic is still open, although an accreditation group is calling for it to suspend procedures and surgeries, according to letters obtained by CNN. Patients were seen in the clinic's waiting room Wednesday.

The American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities (AAAASF) sent representatives for an unscheduled visit to the clinic after hearing about Rivers' cardiac arrest, according to letters from the group.

The letters cited two ""deficiencies"" found by the representatives, declared the clinic to be in ""immediate jeopardy"" and placed it on ""emergency suspension."" The accreditation group said the clinic should stop procedures and surgeries ""until accreditation questions are settled.""

The clinic sent CNN a statement Wednesday night in response to questions about the accreditation association's letter putting the facility under ""emergency suspension.""

""Yorkville Endoscopy continues to maintain its federal, state and Quad A (AAAASF) authorization to be operational and provide patient care. Yorkville Endoscopy is committed to adhering to the standards established by Quad A (AAASF),"" the statement said.

While the accreditation agency has no power to shut a clinic down, the state of New York does. State health investigators also found deficiencies in Rivers' treatment, according to a source close to the death investigation. These include the participation of River's personal throat doctor.

Timeline emerges in Joan Rivers' death

Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released.

The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures. ... Nor is he currently serving as medical director.""

The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators.

The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law.

"'Throat specialist to the stars' allegedly involved in fatal Joan Rivers procedure denies taking selfie with star as she releases statement saying she will not comment on tragic incident","Dr Gwen Korovin was inside Yorkville Endoscopy clinic when the star died

Is alleged to have taken a selfie with her before she went into cardiac arrest

Sources close to the doctor, 56, say reports she took photo are 'lies'

Statement by her attorneys says she's 'respected and admired by peers'

56-year-old ENT was not supposed to be in the room during the procedure

'Lies': Dr Gwen Korovin insists reports she took a selfie with Joan Rivers before she went into cardiac arrest are not true

Joan Rivers' personal doctor has said reports she took a selfie with the star before the procedure that allegedly killed the comedienne are 'lies'.

Dr Gwen Korovin - who was not authorized to be in the room at the time of the fatal treatment - has also released a statement saying she has 'no comment' to make about the tragic incident.

Reports suggest the 'throat specialist to the stars' took a photo of the 81-year-old inside Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 before the star stopped breathing while undergoing a procedure on her vocal cords.

However sources close to the ENT have accused CNN - who originally published the story - of 'making up lies'.

According to TMZ she has also denied performing a biopsy on Joan. However it is unknown whether she performed any other procedure while in the room.

Attorneys from Abrams and Fensterman acting on behalf of the medical professional released a statement today, saying she is 'respected and admired' in the medical community, but will not be discussing the incident.

It read: 'Gwen S. Korovin M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains priveleges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr Korovin does not publicly discus her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient.

'For these reasons, neither Dr Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press pleases respect Dr Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients as well as the privacy of her patients.'

The doctor who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist based in Manhattan.

Joan arrived at the Upper East side clinic for an endoscopy with gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, on the morning on August 28. She died on September 4.

The procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.

An ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - then performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords.

The doctor was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist who is reported to be Dr Korovin.

It has been reported that Joan's vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest.

The comedienne was then rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital from the clinic.

However, she never regained consciousness and died days later after being taken off life support and spending her final days with her daughter Melissa Rivers by her side and her loved ones paying their final respects.

Dr Korovin has been earmarked as one of the top specialists in the country and is the choice of many celebrities. She has even been involved in a documentary with Celine Dion.

During a clip from the program, Dr Gwen Korovin is seen conducting an laryngoscopy on the Canadian singer, using a camera to examine Dion's vocal chords as she sings a few notes.

The two go on to share a few laughs in Dr Korovin's clinic room, covered with framed photos of her famous clientele.

"Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy","If the bizarre story about Joan Rivers' doctor pausing to take a ""selfie"" in the operating room minutes before the 81-year-old comedienne went into cardiac arrest on August 29 sounded outlandish, that's because it was. 
So says Dr Gwen Korovin, Rivers' personal physician who on Thursday night shot down a CNN report claiming Korovin was so star-struck she took the opportunity of her celebrity patient being unconscious to snap a souvenir photo of the two of them together.

CNN, citing sources close to the investigation being carried out by the medical examiner's office, is standing by its claim that a sedated Rivers was clearly visible in Korovin's procedure room selfie - an allegation Korovin's lawyers are calling ""lies"".

Korovin, (known as the ""patron saint of Broadway singers and actors"" for her work tending to the likes of Lady Gaga, Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Celine Dion, Mick Jagger and Luciano Pavarotti) also ""categorically"" denied performing an unauthorised biopsy on Rivers which, according to multiple published reports, caused the heart attack that killed the beloved New Yorker during what should have been a routine medical procedure.

Whatever Rivers would have made of the escalating drama surrounding her mysterious death, those close to her say she would be thrilled by the news that Vanity Fair scribe Leslie Bennetts has been signed to write her biography, due out early next year.

""Joan Rivers' life story was, in every way, a remarkably dramatic roller-coaster ride characterised by triumphant highs and devastating lows, one that is both wildly entertaining and deeply moving,"" Bennetts said in a statement. ""It's hard to imagine a more compelling subject for a book or one that would be more fun."" And lucrative. Within hours of Rivers' death, sales of her latest book (Diary of a Mad Diva) shot up an impressive - and record-breaking - 70,750pc on Amazon.

Dowd deals with pot shots

Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Maureen Dowd is on quite a high after learning that she has been cast as the poster girl for a new ""Consume Responsibly"" edible pot publicity campaign.

The 62-year-old New York Times op-ed columnist, who got (unintentionally) stoned last summer while researching a story about Colorado's recent decision to legalise the use of recreational marijuana, doesn't even mind that the pro-pot brigade are making fun of her nightmare experience with cannabis to warn rookies about the dangers of overdosing.

Dowd, who decided to test the benefits of pot with a few bites of a weed-infused chocolate bar wrote about the results (""What could go wrong?"") in a column (titled ""Don't Harsh Our Mellow, Dude"") which was published in June, graphically recalling how - an hour after ingesting the bar, things went haywire.

""I barely made it from the desk to the bed, where I lay curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours... I was panting and paranoid, sure that when the room-service waiter knocked and I didn't answer, he'd call the police and have me arrested for being unable to handle my candy,"" she wrote.

""As my paranoia deepened, I became convinced that I had died and no one was telling me.""

A medical consultant would later tell Dowd that marijuana candy bars ""are supposed to be cut into 16 pieces for novices,"" a point she used to condemn the marijuana industry for promoting the drug without safety precautions for first-time users.

On Wednesday, the advocacy group Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) responded to Dowd's criticism by unveiling a giant billboard featuring a red-haired woman (who looks exactly like the writer) obviously worse for wear on a hotel room bed. ""Don't let a candy bar ruin your vacation,"" reads the tagline. ""With edibles, start low and go slow.""

Dowd, who wasn't in the slightest fazed at her likeness or her story being used in the ad said she has her own plans for artwork from the billboard.

""I'm going to make it my Christmas card. Now,"" she said, adding dryly, ""onto gun control.""","0"

"Here Are Microsoft's New Robot Security Guards","Robots are increasingly replacing humans in a variety of mundane tasks, like bolting a car together or making lollipops, but now they are moving into the security business.

Microsoft recently installed a fleet of 5-feet-tall, 300-pound robots to protect its Silicon Valley campus. The robots are packed with HD security cameras and sensors to take in their organic, protein-based surroundings. There’s also an artificial intelligence on board that can sound alarms when the robot notices something awry. It can also read license plates and cross-reference them to see if they’re stolen.

The K5 robots come from a California company called Knightscope, which calls the robots “autonomous data machines” that provide a “commanding but friendly presence.” Sounds like something a robot manufacturer would say.

Let’s be honest though, the robots look pretty damn cool. They’re like modern versions of R2-D2.

Thankfully—or sadly, depending on how you look at it—the K5 robots don’t have any weapons on them. All they can do is assess a situation, sound an alarm to defuse it, or call a human security officer to the scene. There are, however, plans equip the robots with tasers sometime in the future.

Microsoft’s new protectors are fairly autonomous. A single charge will last 24 hours, and if the robot notices that its battery is getting low, it will return to a charging port and plug itself in. It can fully recharge in 20 minutes, which is pretty insane.

There are plans to one day expand the use of Knightscope’s robots and have them patrol the streets as part of human police units. We can’t even imagine what would happen if Elon Musk heard about this.

"Robot security guards now patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus","A California company is hoping to revolutionize the security business with autonomous robots.

The Knightscope K5 is one of four drones now patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley Campus.

Matt Stambaugh, the Calgary Eyeopener's science and technology columnist, spoke about how the five feet tall robots learn.

""You take them to an area, apparently an operator has to walk around the perimeter where they're supposed to patrol once, then they go about learning their environments,"" said Stambaugh. ""What they're using is a variety of different sensors essentially to take the role of what a lot of private security contractors do today.""

According to Stambaugh, the robots are capable of detecting anomalies and making decisions.

""It's not quite as advanced as what Google is doing with their self-driving car, but they've got different sensors on board to make a map of the area and then they've got code on board to decide what is something that should be reported back.""

""They've got thermal imaging if you need. They've got chemical sensors, licence plate recognition software [and] facial recognition software,"" said Stambaugh. ""It looks kind of like a large Roomba. And so instead of looking for dust bunnies it's looking for, you know, criminals.""

K5s to hit the market in 2015

According to Stambaugh, the robots will be hitting the market starting 2015.

""What the company Knightscope is trying to do is to lease these out on a per-hour basis,"" said Stambaugh. ""So $6.25 an hour they'll lease you one of these K5s and that's about half the price of the average security guard.""

There are many advantages to a robot over a human patrol. 

""They'll work triple shift, 24 hours a day. The battery is supposed to last around a day and when it runs out they go back to a charging carpet and in 20 minutes they are charged up again.""

Stambaugh also said the robots do not have any weapons, but that may change in the future.

""Basically what it's doing is calling back to a manned response centre if something is going wrong,"" he said.","0"
"Microsoft Hires Dalek-style Robocops to Guard Silicon Valley HQ","Computing giant Microsoft is one of the Silicon Valley companies that has hired robot security guards to protect and serve the streets around northern California's technology hub.

The Knightscope K5 robot security guards are fitted with lasers, GPS and heat-detecting technology, and can predict where criminals will strike next and the likelihood of future crimes.

Unlike human security guards, the egg-like Knightscopes are not armed(Knightscope)

The 5ft tall robots are designed to operate without human control and are equipped with surveillance cameras and sensors, a thermal imaging system, scanners that can read 300 car registration plates a minute, and odour detectors. It patrols the streets using lasers to gauge distance and a GPS system.

The robots analyse information from government, businesses and social media sources to predict the likelihood of a crime being committed in a given area, and decide whether the alert authorities it if comes across anything suspicious.

Four of the robot security guards have been deployed to guard Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus, in the system's first real mission.

It appears to be going well, although the robots have come unstuck in the face of a seemingly innocent adversary: steps.

Rachel Metz, a reporter for MIT Technology Review, said: ""I noticed that a K5 in the distance had somehow toppled over the edge of the sidewalk onto the parking-lot asphalt several inches below. A couple of Knightscope folks were needed to pull it upright.""

Well, if Doctor Who's mortal enemies can't handle stairs, what chance to these youngsters have?

"Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus now guarded by Daleks","If you ever visit the Microsoft campus in the Silicon Valley and hear a mechanical voice shout ""Ex-ter-min-ate!"", don't be too spooked. It just means some geek humor has gone a little crazy.

Microsoft's campus in Silicon Valley will be patrolled by a team of five security guard robots from a company called Knightscope. The robot, dubbed K5, is five feet tall, weighs 300 pounds, and looks disturbingly like the Daleks of ""Doctor Who"" fame.

Fortunately, they are not armed with lasers. They use cameras and sensors to monitor their assigned area and look for suspicious activity. They are armed with high-definition cameras and audio recorders, able to record events and voices, analyze faces, read license plates, and even detect biological and chemical agents.

The K5s also use laser scanning and GPS for navigation, have weather sensors, and communicate via Wi-Fi. Their batteries run for about 24 hours and the K5 will return to a dock/power station to recharge.

Should they spot a problem, they call a human security guard. I'm just waiting for Knightscope to decide to cut out the middle man. Or for bored Microsofties to try and hack the thing to play pranks on people.

That sounds like the plot of a bad SyFy movie, doesn't it?","0"
"Microsoft turns to robotic security guards to watch for trouble","OK, so the robot apocalypse probably won’t happen any time soon, but the new robot sentries guarding Microsoft’s Silicon Valley campus seem like something straight out of a futuristic sci-fi movie.

According to ExtremeTech, each of the K5 security guard robots from robotics company Knightscope stands 5 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds, so you probably don’t want to mess with one.

The K5 robots don’t come with any weapons onboard—thankfully—but they use a suite of alarms, sirens, and cameras to monitor and patrol the grounds of Microsoft’s campus. If one spots trouble, it’ll either sound an alarm or dispatch a human security guard to its location. 

ExtremeTech notes that the K5 can run for up to 24 hours on a single charge, and can recharge in only about 20 minutes. Its battery won’t die out in the field, though—these bots will return to the charging station by themselves when their batteries start to run dry.

The story behind the story: Robots are playing an increasingly large role in security and military operations. Google-owned robotics company Boston Dynamics, for example, has been working with DARPA to develop various robots to aid soldiers in combat settings. Meanwhile, South Korea deployed a robotic sentry to guard its side of the Demilitarized Zone  in 2010. Unlike K5, though, South Korea’s guard robot came fully armed.","0"
"Microsoft Tried Out Robot Security Guards on Its Silicon Valley Campus","It seems like robots are everywhere these days, and now they’re rolling around Microsofts Silicon Valley campus R2-D2-style to fight crime and keep everyone safe. At least that’s the idea behind a pilot program the company ran last week to test a fleet of five K5 security guard robots.

Designed and manufactured by robotics company Knightscope, K5s weigh 300 pounds and are 5 feet tall. They use cameras and sensors to keep track of their surroundings and look for suspcious activity. They can “see” license plate numbers and even analyze faces. While K5s aren’t equipped with weapons (and can’t run or get in someone’s face anyway), they do have onboard alarms and sirens to alert people if something bad is going on. And if they spot something that a person should handle, they can call a human security guard over. The K5s also use laser scanning and GPS for navigating, weather sensors, and, of course, Wi-Fi connectivity.

Stacy Stephens, Knightscope’s co-founder and vice president of sales and marketing, told MIT Tech Review, “This takes away the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work, and leaves the strategic work to law enforcement or private security, depending on the application.”

K5s are mostly meant for spotting strange or unusual behavior, but if you’re in trouble you can also use them to call for help. They have battery life of about 24 hours and can automatically bring themselves back to their charging stations when they’re low on juice. And it’s true that there’s artificial intelligence coordinating an A5’s actions and making decisions about where it should go and what it should do next. But reaction to the robots seems kind of alarmist.

ExtremeTech writes that by testing the robots, Microsoft is “[s]howing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization.” That and other comments might be meant as tongue-in-cheek, but the A5s don’t seem any different from the robot guards South Korea piloted in prisons in 2012 or even Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot, which is designed to be used in dangerous situations like natural disaster relief or fire rescues.

If they were armed, A5s might seem scarier, but as eyes and ears that never get tired and can just endlessly putter around a big campus, A5s seem like a reasonable solution.","0"
"Knightscope Security Robots Are Keeping Microsoft Campuses Safe (and They Look Really Scary)","While Daleks ""know no fear"" and ""must not fear,"" the cold, calculating robots from the Dr. Who series don't exist in the real world yet and Microsoft has had to settle on the next best thing for securing its campuses: the K5.

Microsoft is the first company in Silicon Valley to dispatch a fleet of the K5 policing robots. Each 5-foot tall, 300-pound K5 is equipped with arrays of high-definition camera, sensors, debilitating sirens, Wi-Fi and artificial intelligence.

The squat policing robots are the product of Knightscope, a startup firm from Mountain View, Calif. William Santana Li, chairman and CEO of Knightscope, sees a world in which his company's policing robots move out of the private sector and start working alongside law enforcement officers.

""Technology and robotics are making the concept of Precision Policing -- a systematic, proactive and almost precognitive approach to ensuring public safety -- a real possibility,"" said Li in a March blog post.

The K5s can use their sensors to track down threats and their Wi-Fi connection to call in bipedal backup, aka security guards. Their AI and camera rigs enable the K5s to do a good deal of profiling, scanning license plates and faces to compare against databases available to them over Wi-Fi.

The K5 robots are only tools to surveil, assess and report suspicious activity, for now at least. There are plans in the works that could see the K5s brandishing and using Taser guns -- ""you are being neutralized.""

The K5s sensors enable them to recognize and analyze alphanumeric text, heat signatures, sounds, air quality and infrared light. The robots are equipped with both radar and Lidar to help them make measurements, while GPS helps them maintain their bearing and report their positions. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, is a remote-sensing technology used to measure distance by illuminating a target with a laser and then analyzing the reflected light.

The robots are fully autonomous and can even refuel at a charging station without the guidance of humans. The K5s leverage their machine learning abilities for predictive analytics, analyzing and accounting for risks in real time.

To keep people assured that the machines aren't abusing their abilities or beginning to learn too much, Knightscope plans to let people keep an eye on the machines by making the K5s' video feeds available to the public online.

""I believe robots are the perfect tools to handle the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work in order to free up humans to more judiciously address activities requiring higher-level thinking, hands-on encounters, or tactical planning,"" states Li.","0"
"'Dear Sandwich Thief': Man's hilarious response to passive-aggressive sign posted on his office's fridge door sparks incredible kitchen note war","The anonymous note between office colleagues was posted on Facebook

It was shared from a New Zealand radio station and went viral

It is a hilarious note war between the colleagues over a stolen sandwich

The notes were posted on a fridge door in an office kitchen

A frustrated office worker's request to a colleague to stop pinching their lunch from the fridge has sparked a hilarious note war between the two.

The A4 notes pinned to the fridge door of an office kitchen have gone viral on a New Zealand radio Facebook page due to the hilarious content contained on them.

What starts as a simple request to the 'turkey and Swiss on Rye' owner to the 'sandwich thief' to stop stealing their lunch, soon turns into an anonymous office stand-off with several demands being traded.

The passive-aggressive note which started the war between the two office workers

The first demand from the anonymous thief, which infuriates the sandwich thief even further

A return threat from the owner of the 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' that they will bring HR in to conversation

'To the person who keeps stealing my sandwiches (Turkey and Swiss with mayo on Rye)...' the first of many passive-aggressive notes reads.

'Stop stealing other people's property!!!'

What follows is one of several demands from the thief to pay $10 and leave it in the fridge in return for the person's lunch - or they'll 'never see it undigested again.'

The thief, a man, includes a picture of him holding a portion of the 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' - one of many he posts picture with him holding it to prove he has it in his possession.

Refusing to take the sandwich owner's advice to be a 'responsible adult' seriously, he further infuriates 'Turkey and Swiss on rye' who threatens the thief with human resources action.

The conversation loses its professionalism along the way and becomes increasingly personal, before 'Tina from HR' wades in with a note to the sandwich owner.

'Please return the sandwich to the owner and we won't investigate this any further,' Tina writes.

To which the thief replies: 'Buy me a pizza.'

Tina responds: 'No'

The image of the sandwich thief threatening to continue devouring the person's lunch if they don't put $10 in the fridge

The defeated sandwich owner asks...

More evidence that the man is in possession of the sandwich

The owner follows through on his threat to contact HR and a letter from Tina appears on the fridge door

The thief takes his demands to the top

Who would have thought? Tina refuses

The three-way dialogue continues until the thief posts a lengthy note with an image of an empty plate proving that he has devoured the sandwich in full.

It is at this point the alleged thief, 'Francis', is finally found out when Tina traces the printed A4 sheets back to his account.

'Francis we checked the office printer queue and traced the requests back to your desk. Could you please see me at your earliest convenience.'

The hilarious note war winds up with Francis grovelling for his job with a simple one-line request pleading not to be fired.

'Please don't fire me.'

The thief rubs it in even more

The sandwich owner cracks with their first personal spray at the thief

The thief devours the sandwich and posts the finished meal

The frustrated worker posted a sign on the fridge saying, ""To the person who keeps stealing my sandwiches (turkey and Swiss with mayo on rye), this is ridiculous. We are full grown adults, not children. Please take responsibility for your actions and stop stealing other people's property!""

The sandwich thief then came back with a response, asking for ransom money for the stolen turkey and Swiss on rye. 

""Dear turkey and Swiss on rye, I have your precious sandwich. It's safe. For now. Put 10 dollars on the plate in the fridge or you'll never see it undigested again.""

HR then got involved in the situation and told the alleged thief to give back the sandwich and it won't be investigated.

"Sushi lover's entire body left riddled with WORMS after eating contaminated sashimi","It is the most expensive - and many would argue delicious - part of a sushi menu.

But one man's love of sashimi nearly killed him after it led to his body becoming riddled with tapeworm.

The Chinese man had gone to his doctor complaining of stomach ache and itchy skin.

To his horror, scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fish.

One man's love of sashimi nearly killed him after it led to his body becoming riddled with tapeworm

The Chinese man had seen his doctor complaining of stomach ache and itchy skin. Scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm parasites after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fish

Humans contract tapeworm infections from sushi by eating raw fish that has been infected with the worm in its larvae stage.

When fish eat tapeworm eggs, the hatching larvae attach themselves to the intestinal wall of the fish and the worms infect the fish flesh.

Because sushi is not cooked, the larvae can in turn transfer into the flesh of any human that eats the fish.

Once a human is infected, a tapeworm will grow inside the intestine to a length of up to 15metres over a period of weeks. It can survive for years and go undetected for weeks or months, in turn releasing its own eggs that infect other parts of the human body.

Symptoms include fatigue, constipation and abdominal discomfort - which can be so mild the victim may not notice anything is wrong.

If larvae begin to migrate to other parts of the body they can start to eat away at the liver, eyes, heart or brain and cause life-threatening conditions.

Doctors believe some of the uncooked Japanese delicacy of raw meat or fish must have become contaminated.

He was treated at the Guangzhou No. 8 People's Hospital in Guangdong Province, in eastern China.

Research has shown that eating raw or undercooked fish can lead to a variety of parasitic infections.

Tapeworm infections occur after ingesting the larvae of diphyllobothrium, found in freshwater fish such as salmon, although marinated and smoked fish can also transmit the worm.

While cases have increased in poorer areas due to improved sanitation, cases have increased in more developed countries,.

This is most likely due to the soaring popularity of sushi, say doctors writing in the journal Canadian Family Physician.

Study author Nancy Craig wrote: 'The widespread popularity of Japanese sushi and sashimi (slices of raw fish) is a contributor.

'But other popular dishes might also be implicated, such as raw salted or marinated fillets - which originate from Baltic and Scandinavian countries - carpaccio - very thin slices of raw fish common in Italy, raw salmon and ceviche - lightly marinated fish.'

Dr Yin, of Guangzhou No. 8 People’s Hospital, told the website that'smags.com that eating uncooked food contaminated with tapeworms' eggs could eventually cause cysticercosis, when the adult worms enters a person’s blood stream.

This type of infection is life-threatening once it reaches the brain.

"Saudi Arabia's Religious Police Outlaw 'Tempting Eyes'","It's a safe bet that Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of Saudi Arabia's religious police, isn't a fan of Cole Porter. ""The lure of you"" is precisely why Nabet announced yesterday that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice will cover any women's eyes that are deemed ""tempting."" ""The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones"" he said. ""[We] have the right to do so.""
What are ""tempting"" eyes? One Saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are ""uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble."" The Orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting, but if they happen to rely on Merriam-Webster, then it means ""having an appeal."" What is an appeal? According to the dictionary, it is ""arousing a sympathetic response."" And what is sympathetic? ""Showing empathy,"" according to Merriam-Webster.

So there you have it. To allow a women's eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world, one must empathize with her very existence. But the religious police--massively funded by King Abdullah--cannot do this. ""It's so stupid,"" the Saudi journalist tells me. ""I don't know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won't be silent.""

Perhaps they won't be, but the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has some of the most powerful backers in the country. Prince Naif, recently appointed heir to the throne, has said: ""The committee is supported by all sides ... It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee."" No surprise, then, that King Abdullah awarded this draconian body an additional 200 million riyals (about $53 million) in March.

How should America respond to this latest affront to Saudi women? Perhaps it can sponsor a contest of the most tempting eyes in Saudi Arabia. Women will send in pictures of their most tempting look and the winner will get to accompany President Obama during his next meeting with the Saudi dictator.

If Congress reconsidered the recent $60 billion U.S.-Saudi arms deal, the religious police might quickly find it ""tempting"" to stop treating women as property.","0"
"Saudi Arabia outlaws ‘tempting eyes’","A new law in Saudi Arabia banning ‘tempting eyes’ has become the latest example of female oppression in the country.

The law, which states that women with alluring eyes will be forced to wear a full veil, has been branded ‘stupid’ by dissenters and roundly criticised on social media, aina.org reports.

Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of the Saudi Arabian Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, said they ‘had the right’ to force women to cover their face.

‘The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones,’ he said.

‘We have the right to do so.’

Many commentators wondered how the word ‘tempting’ would be applied.

One unnamed journalist in the country suggested it referred to ‘uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup.’

‘Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble,’ they added.

Prince Naif, whose impending ascension to the Saudi throne many hoped would spell an end to this kind of draconian oppression, looks likely to be as intolerant as his father King Abdullah after suggesting that any Muslim should support the Committee’s new law.

‘The committee is supported by all sides,’ he said.

"Saudi Women May Have to Cover Up Sexy Eyes","RIYADH, Saudi Arabia – Saudi women with attractive eyes may be forced to cover them up, the news website Bikya Masr reported, in a move that could mark the latest repressive measure taken against women by the Islamic state.

A spokesperson for Saudi Arabia's Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV), Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, said the committee had the right to stop women revealing ""tempting"" eyes in public.

Women in Saudi Arabia already have to cover their hair, and, in some regions, their faces while in public. If they do not, they face punishments including fines and public floggings.

The CPVPV has repeatedly been accused of human rights violations. Founded in 1940, its function is to ensure Islamic laws are not broken in public in Saudi Arabia.

In 2002 the committee refused to allow female students out of a burning school in Mecca because they were not wearing correct head cover, report said. The decision contributed to the high death toll of 15 people who were killed in the fire.","0"
"‘Tempting Eyes’ Ban: Saudi Women With Pretty Eyes Made To Cover Them Up","A “tempting eyes” ban has just been announced in Saudi Arabia that further represses women more than they already are. In this part of the world, women are known to cover their bodies completely from head-to-toe. The eyes are one of the only parts of their body that are seen in public.

Opposing Views reports that women who have eyes “with a nice shape and makeup” could be deemed too tempting to other men, and police can make them wear veils. Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice announced this decision a few days ago. It’s one bound to get universal criticism.

Assyrian International News Agency covered what the Saudi Arabian committee’s spokesman has to say about the new law. Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, explains that Saudi police “have a right” to make a woman cover her eyes.

“The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones. We have the right to do so.”

This development has sparked the question of what defines “tempting eyes” and how will women be evaluated on having them? An unidentified journalist in the nation best describes what Saudi police are going after.

“Uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.”

He adds that a lot of people in Saudi Arabia will be very upset about the law. This type of control will outrage citizens of the country, the unnamed journalist says.

“It’s so stupid. I don’t know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won’t be silent.”

The report notes that no divide between Church and State exists in Saudi Arabia. The bad part is that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has powerful “backers” that include Prince Naif, the heir to the nation’s throne. He announced that the committee “should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.”

If there was any hope among the people that King Abdullah’s son would steer Saudi Arabia in a different direction, it’s lost at this point. By supporting the committee, the prince also supports the “tempting eye ban.” Oppression will continue in the nation, as women are considered nothing more than property.

"If They Are Beautiful, The Woman Will Be In Trouble': Saudi Arabia Religious Police Ban 'Tempting Eyes'","As if women were not subjugated enough already in Saudi Arabia, the nation’s Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice announced yesterday that “tempting eyes” would be subject to veils if deemed inappropriate.

Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of the Saudi Arabian committee, said in the announcement that, ""The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones. We have the right to do so.""

The new ban on well-manufactured facial features is broad enough to lead to some inquiry on the definition of ""tempting eyes."" Moreover, what is the process by which a woman will be found guilty of having “tempting eyes?” A humorous image can only come to mind with long lines of “tempting eyed women” waiting to be brought before the 1984-esque committee.

According to an unnamed journalist in Saudi Arabia, “tempting eyes” could possibly be defined with these stipulations: ""Uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble."" 

The unnamed journalist went onto say, ""It's so stupid. I don't know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won't be silent.""

While in most Western nations there is harsh divide between Church and State, in Saudi Arabia no such segmentation exists. In March, King Abdullah awarded the committee more than $53 million to continue enforcing their religious dogma via the estimated 3,500 to 4,000 religious police officers, which patrol the streets.    

As King Abdullah nears the end of his reign, there was hope that a younger and more liberal dictator would follow. Prince Naif was recently appointed as the heir to the throne, but after giving his support to the committee, there is little hope that Saudi Arabia will evolve in the human rights department.

""The committee is supported by all sides,” Naif said. “It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.""

The parental “because I told you so” argument lacks logic and rationale, but such is the case when a nation resides under monarch rule. It remains unclear how many women will be found or charged with ""tempting eyes,"" but if there is a great enough dissenting voices, public outcry will hopefully have some bearing on the obscene policy.

"Mom Calls 911 On Masturbating Teenage Son; Boy Arrested, Charged With New ‘Self-Rape’ State Law","Phoenix, AZ — A Phoenix boy is behind bars tonight after his mother called 9-1-1 when she found her son in his room, watching pornography and masturbating. Phoenix Police were quick to respond, arresting 15-year-old Paul Horner, who attends North Valley High School in Phoenix, Arizona. Now the teenager is being held without bail and charged by prosecutors under a new controversial Arizona state law called ‘Self-Rape’, which carries a minimum of 3 years in prison with a maximum of 15 years behind bars depending on that individuals past criminal history.

This is the first time this new state law has been used since it was put into action last month by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. Brewer spoke with local news station ABC 15 about the charges against the boy.

“I applaud the Arizona District court systems here in Phoenix,” Brewer said. “This is exactly why I implemented the state law of ‘Self-Rape’ last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. Before my time as governor is up early next year, I’ll do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don’t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it’s too late.”

Horner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the United States District Court in Phoenix, which included the brand new ‘Self-Rape’ state law, Horner immediately broke down into tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.

Transcripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Help! My son is watching porn and masturbating! That is not allowed in his house and I don’t know what kind of demons possessed him to degrade his body in such a matter. I’m so shakin’ up! Please send help immediately!”

32-year-old Adeline Horner, Horner’s mother, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.

“Up until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,” Horner’s mother said. “But somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil’s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!”

Winters controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.

“STOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Adeline Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,” Childs told reporters. “She really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.”

A mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Ant-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 36-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.

“Fappy® has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things. Our organization is passionate about the great work that we do. The children even have a nickname for Fappy®, they call him the tickle monster. Working side by side with such great women as Jan Brewer, we’re ridding the demons from these heathens pants, one pair of pants at a time. Fappy® vows to stay on this case until justice is served!”

Tom Downey with the Phoenix Police Department, who took the child into custody, spoke with Arizona news station Fox 10 News about the arrest.

“We thought at first he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about how we should leave him alone and just let him watch his filth, makes me sick! It’s a slippery slope my friend, one day it’s masturbating to porn, the next day it’s raping some innocent school girl. Thank God we got this heathen off the streets before another tragedy could have occurred.” Downey continued, “There’s no better feeling than putting the real bad guys behind bars. Nothing better than that. I know I can sleep better at night just knowing another criminal is off the streets.”

Officers confiscated the pornography and lube found in the teenagers room as evidence.

Prosecutors told local reporters that based on the severity of the crime, the new Arizona state law of Self-Rape [A.R.S. §§ 29-169 & 48-69] would carry a minimum of 3 years with a maximum of 15 years depending on that criminals past history.

Horner is currently being held at the Maricopa County Jail in Phoenix, Arizona. He presently has no bond set and the judge has restricted him from seeing visitors. Horner’s next scheduled court appearance is December 2nd.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach both children and adults about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. For more information or if you would like the group to visit your child’s school call (785) 273-0325. To contact Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, call (602) 542-4331.

"Was Alleged Audio of Michael Brown Shooting on CNN a Hoax?","Mediaite writes about CNN’s morning show questioning the reporting of one of CNN’s evening shows.

Monday night, “CNN Tonight” aired an audiotape purported to capture the shooting of Michael Brown. The tape was brought to CNN by St. Louis attorney Lopa Blumenthal, (at right with anchor Don Lemon) who says a former client gave it to her. Lemon repeatedly said that CNN could not verify the authenticity of the tape.

TVNewser has learned CBS News received the same audio earlier this week from Blumenthal, but chose not to run it because it could not be verified.

This morning on “New Day,” two guests on CNN doubted the veracity of it.

“I’ve told your producers that for all I know this is something one of Howard Stern’s punk people had been doing. I look at this and my first inclination is someone is trying to punk CNN,” said former LAPD officer David Klinger. CNN analyst Tom Fuentes also doubted its authenticity: “When I heard this yesterday, I thought the exact same thing: it’s a hoax.”

WaPo’s Erik Wemple reported yesterday on how CNN got its hands on the audiotape. When asked about its authenticity, a CNN spokesperson told Wemple, “[W]e interviewed the caller’s attorney off camera and she answered key questions that gave us confidence to put her on the air live with Don. And we did confirm the caller lived close enough to the shooting to have heard the shots.”

Now it appears, there are doubts inside CNN.","0"
"CNN Expert on Brown Audio: At First I Thought ‘Someone’s Trying to Punk CNN’","Former LAPD officer David Klinger and CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes both told CNN’s New Day Wednesday morning that the recording the network has been airing that allegedly captured the shots fired at Michael Brown could quite easily be a hoax.

“I have no idea [if it's authentic],” Klinger said. “I’ve told your producers that for all I know this is something one of Howard Stern’s punk people had been doing. …I look at this and my first inclination is someone is trying to punk CNN.”

RELATED: Limbaugh: CNN ‘Flat-Out Irresponsible’ for Hyping Alleged Mike Brown Audio

“When I heard this yesterday, I thought the exact same thing: it’s a hoax,” Fuetnes said, explaining:

“The engineers in the laboratory at Quantico will be trying to determine if there was a dubbing; did we have an original recording of this guy having a conversation no one wants to talk about, and then the shots then dubbed over it; was it the complete tape? All accounts from Brown’s side and the officer’s side say there was a single shot fired initially at the door of the police car. So that shot, followed by Brown trying to flee, and then the officer exiting the car and pursuing him and then firing the series of shots — so we’re missing that first shot. Now, I don’t know, CNN got this tape first. Did they censor it because the guy said something obscene over the first shot and they didn’t want to air that? We just don’t know all that.”

New Day cohost Michaela Pereira defended the airing of the tape. “It needs to be said the lawyer who is representing the man who gave us the audio gave it to us, she swears it is real,” Pereira said. “We have no reason here at CNN to believe that it’s not true.”

"Is the Alleged Audio of the Gunshots That Killed Michael Brown a Hoax?","At least two experts are questioning the authenticity of an audio file that is purported to have captured the gunshots that killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.

CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes and former Los Angeles police officer David Klinger both said Wednesday morning that they initially felt the recording alleged to reveal the sequence of shots fired by Officer Darren Wilson was a hoax, according to Mediaite.

“I’ve told your producers that for all I know this is something that one of Howard Stern’s punk people have been doing … I don’t have a high degree of confidence in it,” Klinger said on CNN’s “New Day.” “I look at this and my first inclination is that someone is trying to punk CNN.”

He cited the fact that the clip emerged two weeks after the shooting as well as the curious words being voiced by a man in the audio as reasons why he doubted its authenticity, though he said he remains open to seeing whether an investigation finds it legitimate.

A man’s voice can be heard in the audio telling a woman, “You are pretty. You’re so fine, just going over some of your videos. How could I forget?” The context of the remarks is unclear, though purported gunshots can be heard in the background.

And Klinger wasn’t alone in his skepticism. Fuentes also said that he has qualms over the authenticity of the audio.

“When I heard this yesterday, I thought the exact same thing — it’s a hoax, but maybe not. Maybe they’ll be able to authenticate it,” he said.

Fuentes said that the FBI’s investigation will likely include engineers at Quantico examining the audio to see if there was any dubbing and to examine whether the complete tape was delivered to CNN, Mediaite reported.

Watch their comments below:

CNN “New Day” co-host Michaela Pereira noted that an attorney — a woman named Lopa Blumenthal — had delivered the audio to the network, vouching for its authenticity on behalf of her unnamed client.

"NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014!","WORLDWIDE - NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 6 days of almost complete darkness and will happen from the dates Tuesday the 16 – Monday the 22 in December. The world will remain, during these three days, without sunlight due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight.

This is the head of NASA Charles Bolden who made the announcement and asked everyone to remain calm. This will be the product of a solar storm, the largest in the last 250 years for a period of 216 hours total. Reporters interviewed a few people to hear what they had to say about the situation with Michael Hearns responding “We gonna be purgin my n*gga, six days of darkness means six days of turnin up fam”.

Despite the six days of darkness soon to come, officials say that the earth will not experience any major problems, since six days of darkness is nowhere near enough to cause major damage to anything. “We will solely rely on artificial light for the six days, which is not a problem at all”, says NASA scientist Earl Godoy.

"Kurt Sutter Announces Plans For ‘Sons Of Anarchy’ Movie Starring Charlie Hunnam, Brad Pitt","NORTH HOLLYWOOD, California -

Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.

Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said.

Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.

“I am most excited about bringing Brad (Pitt) on as John Teller, he is absolutely perfect for the role. The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series.”

Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. “Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. I’ve never gone public with this, but I’ve had people get really crazy when they see me in public,” said Sutter. “They shout at me, and they get angry - ‘You shouldn’t have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!,’ that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because I’m kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope.”

Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. “For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016,” said Sutter. “In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can. Every dollar goes to helping get this movie completed. Brad Pitt isn’t cheap, you know.”","0"
"Pumpkin Spice Condoms Could Be The Only Thing To Save The World From Basic Children","In a mass influx of basicness, it seems Durex may or may not be hopping on the pumpkin spice bandwagon.

This past weekend, images of a Starbucks PSL-inspired condom took social media by storm.

Is this a ploy to get basic bitches of the world to stop procreating? Will they actually be able to convince a potential partner to wrap it up with something as bizarre as this? Is there even a demand for a product like this?

The image is an altered image of Durex’s flavored “Taste Me” condom line, which just begs me to ask one question: Can your genitals taste flavors?

Oh, wait… That’s not what they were getting at, is it?

There have been no official corporate announcements determining if this will be a reality or not. But, after seeing this image spread, why wouldn’t Durex look into this?

If there’s anything that could get the population on the condom train it would have to be the PSL trend, right?

Sounds like an easy moneymaker to me, even if it’s just a novelty.

"Durex is not confirming or denying rumors of a “pumpkin spice” condom","Word that Durex was rolling out a pumpkin-spice-flavored condom swept through social media over the weekend:

The autumnal-themed birth control may well be just an internet invention, a riff on Starbucks’ wildly popular coffee drink. The photo in the tweet above appears to be an altered version of Durex’s flavored “Taste Me” range of condoms, which come in apple, strawberry, banana and orange, but not (yet) pumpkin. There have been no corporate announcements about any new offering.
Several emails to Durex’s parent company, Reckitt Benckiser, and Virgo Health, the PR company that handles communications for Durex, didn’t yield a conclusive answer. A spokeswoman for Virgo Health said she couldn’t say whether the company was or was not actually developing such a thing.
Reckitt Benckiser has been growing the Durex brand in emerging markets, as Quartz reported earlier, and transforming it into a “sexual well-being brand.” But plans for any holiday-themed contraception remain mysterious, or possibly imaginary, even ones involving a certain cult cinnamon and nutmeg-laced spice flavor.","0"
"Is Durex Planning To Release A Pumpkin Spice Condom?","If you spent enough time on Twitter this weekend, you probably saw this photo on your feed:

So far, they’re playing it cool, neither confirming nor denying the existence of a pumpkin-flavored love glove.

"Durex on Rumored ‘Pumpkin Spice’ Condom: No Comment","Happy Monday! It’s now unofficially Fall, which means you’ll see the word “pumpkin” trotted out even more often than the phrase “Apple product launch” this month.

Brands like Starbucks do not seem to have heeded the “enough with the pumpkin stuff!” warning; as friend of the site Dave Armon of Critical Mention wrote in one of those rare comments worth reading:

“Like it or not, Starbucks is killing it with this story. We spotted 75 airings on U.S. TV and radio stations today, through 5:45 p.m. ET. Personally, I’ll wait until I can see my breath before ordering anything pumpkin flavored.”

This point goes a long way toward explaining why Durex and its PR AOR Virgo Health refused to give Quartz a definitive answer on the most absurd trend to emerge from Twitter this weekend:

If it’s real, the client wins. If it’s fake, the client still wins. Why stop the world from wondering?

"‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ May Get An Early Release Date—Report","“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2015 that is scheduled to be released during winter. The latest reports, however, claim that J.J. Abrams, the director of the seventh episode of the epic space opera, wants an early release date for his movie.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is currently scheduled to be released on Dec. 18, 2015. Based on YouTuber Votesaxon 07’s video, Movie Pilot reports that J.J. Abrams wants to release “Episode 7” in the summer of 2015. The report by the aforementioned entertainment news publication claims that the 48-year-old director made the announcement at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015.

The publication claims that the reason why J.J. Abrams wants to release “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” almost six months before its scheduled date is the alleged plot and images leaks from the sets and script. The moviemaker is now worried that these plot leaks will make the film “predictable and not worth watching” for the audience.

According to the website, moving the release date forward would be “an extremely brave move,” putting it up against other fan-favourite releases such as “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Jurassic World” and “Ant-Man.” However, shifting the release date means a lot of work for the moviemakers and the studio. Meanwhile, Ikwiz reports that Disney is “seriously” considering J.J. Abrams' demand of summer release of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

Fans must note that these reports lack official comments from the associated parties; thus, the information must be taken with a pinch of salt. However, fans know that Disney is seriously dealing with the issue of image leak. Recently, the studio issued a subpoena over the leak of images from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

In additional news, J.J. Abrams finally broke his silence on the controversy over the new lightsaber that debuted in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” trailer. Speaking to Collider at a Hollywood event, the director admitted receiving tons of emails arguing about the new lightsaber and its functionality.

""It's been the funniest thing to see the arguments that have developed over this thing,” J.J Abrams said. ""This was not done without a lot of conversation. It's fun to see people have the conversation that we had, but in reverse,” the director explained.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” features John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, Harrison For as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and Domhnall Gleeson, Max von Sydow and Adam Driver, all in unspecified roles. Stay tuned for more updates.

"Star Wars VII for a New SUMMER Release Date!?","In quite recent news, J J Abrams has reportedly said at the Visual Effects Society Awards (2015) that he may release his extremely anticipated film, Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens. instead of winter he may move his film down the line for a summer release! This is an extremely brave move (if true) as it puts Star Wars up against films like Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron, Ant-Man and the long awaited Jurassic World but who would win at the summer box office if it were to happen? In my opinion Star Wars has got the strongest chance at the box office if moved to a summer release but why would he do it? All the big films come out in the summer and I mean there's no Hobbit to compete with in December so why move it down to Summer?

Box office championship.
Box office championship.
J J's biggest reason was reported to be that all of the Star Wars plot leaks and pictures of characters had sent him on a little scare that more and more would be leaked therefore making the film predictable and not worth watching. For example just one photo can give away a lot for instance: (If you don't want spoilers look away!)

Sorry J J!
Sorry J J!
For instance these 5 figures reveal the character's Kylo Ren, Rey, Fin, BB-8 and shows us what Kylo Ren (ol' crossguard) will look like with his outer cloak removed. I do see that if more of these pictures are leaked we could be seeing what Han, Leia, Luke, C3PO etc. will be like in the film before seeing a company made trailer, which would ruin the surprise. Disney, being the owners of the new Star Wars franchise, have taken J J's thoughts into consideration and deep thought which could get the film released a lot earlier than we thought we were going to see it! There are some bad things about this though... If we do get what we all wish for and we get to see Star Wars 7 about 6 months before we thought we were going to, won't Disney be in a panic? If they thought that their blockbuster was coming in December would they have ordered toy designs, trailers etc. for later on in the year? Perhaps this is just paranoia but Disney and J J will have a lot of work to get done if they want their merchandise etc. to come alongside Star Wars in summer.

A site called iKwiz is reporting that director J.J. Abrams, has asked Disney for the release date of Star Wars: Episode VII to be moved up from it’s original release date.

According to the site, Abrams had said it himself while addressing a group of attendees at the 2015 Visual Effects Society Awards about his frustration about the leaked pictures floating around the web. The site also states that Disney is taking Abrams’ request very seriously.

But if there's truth to these recent release date rumors, the sequel could be hitting the cinemas on an earlier schedule.

An article from The Telegraph cited two separate ""unconfirmed reports"" from Ikwiz and Movie Pilot indicating that instead of winter, Star Wars VII might arrive in theaters ""this summer.""

""J J's biggest reason was reported to be that all of the Star Wars plot leaks and pictures of characters had sent him on a little scare that more and more would be leaked therefore making the film predictable and not worth watching,"" Movie Pilot wrote.

Ikwiz meanwhile stated that ""Disney is reportedly taking Abrams' request very seriously, and is looking at a possible summer release.""

This conclusion was apparently drawn from the statement which the ""Star Trek"" helmer gave off during the Visual Effects Society Awards (2015) event on Feb. 4 where Abrams received the VES Visionary Award.

John Boyega, who is set to appear in the ""Star Wars"" sequel, recently shared his appreciation for the brilliance Abrams has put in the gigantic film project.

""It was brilliant,"" Boyega told BBC. ""J.J. Abrams is obviously a passionate guy and does well in this movie and I can't wait for it come out.""

"‘Islamic tribunal confirmed in Texas’","Breitbart Texas reports:

An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a non-profit organization in Dallas. One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal’s decisions are “voluntary.”

Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” El-badawi said their organization is “a tribunal, not arbitration.” A tribunal is defined by Meriam-Webster’s Dictionary as “a court or forum of justice.” The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” not “arbitrators.”

El-badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters. He said they also resolve workplace disputes.

In matters of divorce, El-badawi said that “while participation in the tribunal is voluntary, a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal.” He compared their divorce, known as “Talaq,” as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage.

An Examiner.com article seems troubled by this.

This, though, is a perfectly normal practice within religious groups in America. El-badawi is right that Catholics have long gone to Catholic authorities to resolve certain questions related to marriage. Orthodox Jews have long gone to Jewish religious courts (such a court is called a “beth din”) both to resolve marital matters and to resolve commercial disputes. Some Protestants sometimes do the same; 1 Corinthians 6:1 is often interpreted as calling for that.

There are three ways in which these tribunals’ decisions have practical effect.

1. Parties’ respect for the system: Religious people may often feel personally obligated to follow the judgments of respected authorities on their religious law. For instance, a Catholic who doesn’t get an annulment might feel obligated not to remarry, even if he thinks that he should have gotten the annulment, simply because he feels that God wants him to follow the church’s teachings and decisions.

2. Social pressure: Would observant Muslims feel pressured to abide by a sharia tribunal’s ruling, when that will affect how their coreligionists, business partners, neighbors, and family members perceive them? You bet. Would Orthodox Jews feel the same? You bet, and I expect that Christians who operate within sufficiently devout and religiously homogeneous communities would have the same reaction. For an interesting, but rare, case of the legal system being asked to intervene to stop such social pressure and refusing to do so, see Paul v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y (9th Cir. 1987). (I think that, even in the absence of the Free Exercise Clause that were made in that case, but that might be unavailable in many states following Employment Division v. Smith (1990), a campaign urging people to shun the excommunicated would be protected under the Free Speech Clause, see NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. (1982).)

Indeed, one common argument in favor of religiosity is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations (not to steal, not to commit adultery, and more). The flip side is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations that we might not agree with (stay with a husband who mistreats you, never remarry, and so on). Of course, if there is also the threat of violence and not just community pressure, then the law can step in to punish the violence, and any explicit threats of violence. But the possibility of such violence in rare cases doesn’t allow the legal system to step in to block nonviolent social pressure in other cases.

3. The parties could also enter into a binding arbitration agreement, under which they agree that the tribunal’s decision would be enforceable in civil court. Such agreements are common with secular commercial arbitration, even when the arbitration is supposed to apply law other than American law (e.g., English law or French law). And they are also permissible for religious arbitration.

There are interesting questions about whether an arbitral decision is enforceable in secular American court if it applies substantive or procedural rules that discriminate based on race, religion or sex. I discuss this a bit in this post, and the comments to it are also much worth reading. But according to the Breitbart Texas article, El-badawi says that these tribunals do not conduct legally binding arbitrations; rather, their decisions are followed — when they are followed — as a result of the parties’ acquiescence and community pressure. As a result, these interesting questions don’t arise here.

Religious communities have long had the right to use standard American contract law — coupled with the standard American liberty to exert social pressure on your family members, friends, neighbors and business partners — to have religious decisionmakers decide disputes. That’s especially so when the decisions are enforced just by community members’ own religious feelings, or by social pressure. But that can also be so, subject to some limitations, when the parties to the dispute agree to binding arbitration (which, again, doesn’t seem to be in play with the Texas Islamic tribunal).

The remedy for those who disapprove of the religious law is leaving the community (or the religion). That is of course often very hard, for personal and economic reasons. It’s hard for Muslims. It’s hard for Orthodox Jews (and especially groups such as the Satmar Hasidim). It’s hard for Mormons, Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Amish, and members of lots of other groups. But that’s a necessary aspect of American social and religious freedom.","0"
"Islamic Tribunal Using Sharia Law In Texas Has Been Confirmed Tribunal members say they will avoid Sharia's ""criminal law.""","Breitbart Texas has confirmed the existence of an Islamic tribunal in Texas that will make judgments in accordance with Sharia law.

The website for the Islamic tribunal states: “It is with this issue that Muslims here in America are obligated to find a way to solve conflicts and disputes according to the principles of Islamic Law and its legal heritage of fairness and justice in a manner that is reasonable and cost effective.”

Advertisement-content continues below

The website states that Sharia’s well known criminal law, which includes things like cutting off hands of offenders, is only a portion of Sharia law. This tribunal would not do such things, but will focus on civil Sharia law rather than criminal Sharia law.

Breitbart Texas interviewed one of the tribunal’s “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. El-badawi said that the tribunal is done in accordance with Sharia as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” He also added that the tribunal is not arbitration. The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” instead of “arbitrators.” He said that the tribunal will resolve civil business and family disputes, as well as workplace disputes.

El-badawi was asked what would happen if there is conflict between the laws of Texas and Sharia law. He responded that the laws are in agreement most of the time, but said that Sharia would take precedence out of the two in the tribunal.

There are four judges listed on the tribunal’s website: Imam Yusuf Z.Kavakci, Imam Moujahed Bakhach, Imam Zia ul Haque Sheikh, and Dr. El-badawi.","0"
"Texas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected","Texas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected.

A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.

According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”

Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.

The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of Ebola on US soil.

Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”

Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”

A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.","0"
"Woman Gets Third Boob Implanted, Wants to Be ""Unattractive to Men""","A massage therapist from Tampa, Fla. has spent $20,000 to get a third breast implanted dead center between the right one and the left one as a way to become unattractive to men. She claims that she isn't interested in dating anymore.

Jasmine Tridevil contacted over 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who was willing to to perform the surgery to add a third breast. In an interview with local radio station Real Radio 104.1, Tridevil explained that ""My mom ran out the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad . . . he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,"" she said.

The doctor who performed the surgery couldn't add an areola so Tridevil had one tattooed on instead. As the woman told 104.1, her biggest dream is to have an MTV reality show.

"Woman pays $20,000 for third breast to make herself LESS attractive to men","No, you do not need to adjust your sets, you are actually looking at a woman with three breasts.

Jasmine Tridevil wants to work on TV and in a bid to get there she has spent $20,000 on surgery to get an extra boob.

It was a bit of an uphill struggle for Jasmine, however, as she says she asked between 50 and 60 doctors but none of them wanted to do it because they would be breaking ethics codes.

It took two years to save up for the surgery but it has now been finished, topped off with a tattooed nipple.

She told Real Radio 104.1: My whole dream is to get this show on MTV.

"Meet the 3-boobed woman","A woman has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.

The Florida massage therapist, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, said she had the surgery a few months ago.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” Tridevil told Real Radio 104.1.

“I called like 50 or 60 doctors, nobody wanted to do it.”

Last month she posted a YouTube video of herself in a bikini while Radiohead’s Creep plays in the background.

Tridevil said her extra breast felt like her other breasts, “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

Tridevil said that while she wanted fame and fortune, this was not why she had the surgery.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore,” she said.

She has been filmed telling her parents about the third boob and they were not happy.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said.

While some have criticized Tridevil for her chasing fame, others have described her as “beautiful” and commented that she reminds them of the girl in the sci-fi film “Total Recall.”

“I love boobs, you have three, what’s not to like … we all loved that girl in Total Recall, now your (sic) the real deal,” said one follower on her Facebook page.","0"
"‘Three-boobed‘ woman: They’re not fake","She made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as Tampa Bay’s 10 News revealed Tridevil, whose real name is Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three-breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on Sept. 16.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prosthesis.”

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumor site Snopes also discovered that her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone to whom Tridevil bears a striking resemblance.

However, when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be skeptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Photo: FaceookTridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50 to 60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for.”

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr. Anthony Youn agreed that while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely that anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip, Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple,” which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” on her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different … that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre-surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

It’s not the first time Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after he made unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges, she offered her attacker an ultimatum, telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women.’”

"Florida woman claims to have surgically added third breast","A Florida woman — because where else? — claims to have gotten a third breast surgically implanted dead-centre on her chest.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her birth name) says she spoke with over 50 cosmetic surgeons before she found one willing to break the ethical boundaries of his profession for $20,000.

“They put a mini-implant to make it look like a nipple poking out,” she told The News Junkie, an Orlando radio show. “And for a while it didn’t have an areola but I got a tattoo.”
The motivation for the third breast was not to pay homage to Total Recall, apparently, but because Tridevil wants to become “unattractive” since she is not interested in dating anymore. This is an explanation that must have made more sense on paper.

She says she has also hired a camera crew to follow her around in the hopes that MTV will give her a reality TV show.

“I saved up for two years and I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this so if it doesn’t work, I’m through.”

She also said relations with her parents were somewhat strained after she revealed her surprise surgery to them.

Three-breasted? Jasmine Tridevil, 21, claims she paid $20,000 to have a third breast surgically attached to her chest. She is now filming her own reality show about the struggles she faces as a three-breasted woman

Surgeons are reluctant to perform unnatural procedures as the ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.'

Tridevil claims she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the operation on the grounds that she kept their name a secret.

The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate.

And she has proudly declared that she been disowned by her mother and sister, who ran out the room in disgust when they saw what she had done.

Tridevil’s dubious story is not helped by the fact that all the available images of her appear to have been taken by herself, with no third parties present, and that the footage she has posted is decidedly grainy.

And now the internet sleuths of Snopes have weighed in with some pretty convincing research that indicates Tridevil may be playing the media. It points out:

'...The JASMINETRIDEVIL.COM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler, and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa-area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler (whose ""Alisha's Golden Touch"" massage web site now bears legends identifying her as ""Provider of internet hoaxes since 2014"" and ""Specialist in massage for three breasted women""). Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the ""third breast"" photos.'

Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.

However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.

She told The Sun (£): “This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people don’t believe it, that’s up to them.”

Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a ""quick flash"" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Meanwhile Jezebel spoke to an attending plastic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles.

"Woman Adds Third Breast by Undergoing Surgery to Participate in Reality Show","In order to become a reality star, a woman from Florida underwent an expensive surgery to implant a third breast on her chest.

Massage therapist Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) decided to take the extreme step as she wants her own reality show on MTV, the 9 News reported.

Tridevil reportedly spent $20,000 to have a third breast. The procedure was done a few months ago and the extra breast was constructed with silicone implants and skin tissues taken from her abdomen, the website reported.

However, Tridevil's doctors could not create an artificial areola, which she managed on her own by tattooing it.

Nevertheless, the reality show aspirant had a difficult time finding a doctor who would do the procedure by ignoring medical ethics.

""I called 50 doctors. It was really hard finding someone who would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she told real radio 104.1, via 9News.

When asked about her family's reaction to the creepy news of her third breast implant, she said: ""My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.""

Tridevil went on to claim she wanted this to happen to make herself look unattractive as she is not interested in dating anymore.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

""Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore make-up and cute clothes, I can still, you know, feel pretty.""

Reality shows on popular networks have always fascinated youngsters who want to grab their 15 minutes of fame and become popular.

""Reality and fantasy are blurred. The consequences of bad behaviour and poor choices are never questioned. On the contrary, bad behaviour is welcomed because sensationalism attracts more viewers. The danger lies in that they lose sight of their own sense of self-worth and critical thinking,"" a report from NDLA reads.

"Woman has surgery to get third breast: The three most statistically unlikely pairs of boobs","After the news that a Floridian woman had an operation to add a third boob to her chest, we decided to look at the world's weirdest breasts

Jasmine Tridevil, a Floridian massage therapist, has had an operation to give herself a third breast, in what is perhaps the most controversial boob job of 2014.

We decided to look at the three most statistically unlikely pairs of breasts in the world.

1. Jasmine Tridevil- Three breasts

Jasmine had to call 50-60 doctors in order to get her controversial operation. She said: “It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics”.

She did it because she wanted a reality TV show on MTV, but she had another reason, too.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

Average: Most women have two breasts

2. One of the most extreme boob jobs

Model Sarah Marie Summer - who's addicted to boob jobs The 23-year-old glamour model who has had three surgeries to go up a whopping 18 bra sizes wants to go even bigger

We didn't know this was possible.

Sarah Marie Summer, from Sydney, who is 'addicted to boob jobs' went up 18 cup sizes and has had four boob jobs.

Her boob jobs, which have got her to an M cup, have won her fans and modelling work.

This is one of the most extreme possible boob jobs.

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

3. World's largest natural boobs- 48V

Annie Hawkins-Turner won the Guinness World Record for the biggest natural breasts. Her boobs started developing at the age of nine. She said: ""I just started growing, and kept right on. I started wearing a bra when I was in third grade, and it was a regular grown-up woman's bra. I don't remember ever wearing a training bra.""

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

"Jasmine Tridevil: The woman with three breasts","A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.

The Florida massage therapist, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, said she had the surgery a few months ago.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” Tridevil told Real Radio 104.1.

“I called like 50 or 60 doctors, nobody wanted to do it.”

Last month she posted a YouTube video of herself in a bikini while Radiohead’s Creep plays in the background.

Tridevil said her extra breast felt like her other breasts, “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

“My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,” she said.

“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

Tridevil said that while she wanted fame and fortune, this was not why she had the surgery.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore,” she said.

She has been filmed telling her parents about the third boob and they were not happy.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad ... he really isn’t happy ... he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said.

While some have criticised Tridevil for her chasing fame, others have described her as “beautiful” and commented that she reminds them of the girl in the sci fi film Total Recall.

“I love boobs, you have three, what’s not to like ... we all loved that girl in Total Recall, now your (sic) the real deal,” said one follower on her Facebook page.

"Breast Chancer","Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

We have submitted a request for an interview with Jasmine to verify her claim and have not yet received a response.

"Tampa woman claims to add 3rd breast","Tampa, Florida -- She's an Internet sensation: Jasmine Tridevil, the 21-year-old Tampa woman who claims to have had a third breast implanted. Her video on YouTube has almost a million hits and her pictures on Facebook have gone global.

10 News spoke with her in an exclusive interview.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" said Tridevil.

She agreed to the interview on the condition we only discuss her self-produced show she hopes will be picked up by a cable network, and when we asked to see her third breast, she obliged, but with only a quick flash. When asked her why we couldn't have a longer look Tridevil responded, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that, but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags.

""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person,"" said Greenwald.

And Jasmine's reaction to that.

""I saw it coming.""

"Tiger Woods serving secret PED suspension?","A PGA Tour golfer said he has sources who tell him that Tiger Woods is currently serving a one-month suspension for PED use. 

Tiger Woods has had a tough career as of late, plagued with injuries and surgeries that have complicated his strong golf swing, and now that he’s taken “a leave of absence” until his golf game is “tournament ready,” he’s facing criticism.

This criticism blew up Monday morning when professional, but not well-known PGA Tour golfer Dan Olsen went on a radio interview with David “Mad Dog” DeMarco on 730 WVFN’s The Game in Lansing, MI and claimed that Tiger Woods is serving a suspension for using PEDs.

“I heard he’s on a month suspension,” Olsen said. “And it’s kind of a strong witness, a credible person that’s telling me this… It’s not testosterone, but it’s something else. I think when it is all said and done, he is going to surpass Lance Armstrong with…a…infamy.”

WOW. Dan Olsen, who are you?

Olsen’s dislike for Tiger Woods must be really strong if he’s going to go on radio and make wild claims that haven’t been evidenced by anything or anyone else.

As if this wild claim wasn’t enough, Olsen went on to basically say that Tiger is just one big cheater and dragged Rory McIlroy into it.

“Tiger, he’s got some problems now,” Olsen said. “One of the big problems, Nike’s been giving Tiger a ball that I would almost bet hasn’t been tested…Rory played it too. Remember when Rory signed the Nike deal and he played like an amateur for a year? He was going to fail out of the contract unless he got the high-spin ball too… So if you go to Tour events, Nike pays them, pays the Tour staff and the range staff, they pay them to get all those balls back. That’s why Tiger would never sign a golf ball and give it away… He played a ball that nobody else could play.”

Again, wow. Dan Olsen is going all in on Tiger Woods, staking his reputation (which obviously isn’t much because most people have never heard of him) to call out Tiger as a cheater.

It’s a tough claim to believe, and one you don’t want to believe, either. Tiger Woods is one of the best golfers to play the game and when he’s done he’ll be remembered as the best.

Tiger has played two PGA Tour events this year and he missed the cut in Phoenix in January and withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open in early February after suffering back pain. Because of his back surgery last summer, I guess it wouldn’t be shocking that Tiger would take PEDs, but IF he even has, they certainly haven’t helped him at all. And Tiger is a veteran, he knows about drug testing and he’s gone through it his whole career.

The claims by Olsen, who has played in 35 PGA Tour events in his career with no top ten finishes, seem farfetched and forced, but you can’t discount them completely. We’ll see if this prompts Tiger Woods or the PGA of America to make a statement denying these facts or coming clean on something that may or may not be true.","0"
"Former PGA Tour player: Tiger Woods suspended for drug test failure","A former PGA Tour player claims Tiger Woods has been suspended for one month under the Tour’s anti-doping program.

Dan Olsen, who has made 35 career PGA Tour starts and was an exempt player for the 2004 season, made the claim Friday on radio station WVFN to host David DeMarco.

“I’ve heard that he’s on a month(-long) suspension,” Olsen said, claiming the information came from “exempt Tour players.” Olsen said Woods did not test positive for testosterone but for “something else.”

Olsen continued, “I think when it’s all said and done, he’s going to surpass Lance Armstrong in infamy.”

Woods’ agent Mark Steinberg released a statement to Golf News Net, saying, “These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false. They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.”

PGA Tour media official Joel Schuchmann released a statement on behalf of the Tour, saying, “Regarding the allegations made by Dan Olsen concerning Tiger Woods, there is no truth whatsoever to his claims and the PGA Tour categorically denies them.”

The Michigan-based pro added he believes Woods was faking the back tightness that Woods cited in withdrawing from the Farmers Insurance Open after just 11 holes.

Olsen, whose last PGA Tour start was the 2011 PGA Championship, also made several wild accusations concerning Woods’ golf ball, incorrectly identifying dates during which Woods made changes in the ball he uses. Olsen alluded to comments made by Golf Channel analyst Frank Nobilo concerning the advantage he felt Woods had in 2000 (not 1998 or 1999 as Olsen claimed) in switching to Nike’s first solid-core golf ball. After switch in May 2000, Woods went on to win the final three majors that year, just before Titleist introduced its Pro V1.

Further, Olsen claimed Rory McIlroy wanted out of his Nike contract if he couldn’t have access to the same ball as Woods.

Switching subjects, Olsen also claimed PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem personally visited Dustin Johnson’s home twice in an effort to help the pro with his “personal challenges” before a six-month leave of absence from golf that ended in February. Johnson has disputed a Golf.com report saying he was suspended for that half-year period because of a failed drug test under the Tour’s anti-doping program.","0"
"PGA Tour Pro Claims Tiger Woods Is Currently Suspended For PEDs, Compares Him To Lance Armstrong","For the last few weeks, the general public has assumed that Tiger Woods hasn’t been playing on Tour because of his back and a dog shit golf game, but PGA Tour golfer, Dan Olsen — don’t worry, I haven’t heard of him before either —  is saying that’s simply not the case. Olsen went on record, during a radio interview with 730 WVFN’s David “Mad Dog” DeMarco, claiming his sources are telling him that Tiger Woods is currently serving a one month suspension for failing a drug test. Later in the interview, Olsen says his sources are “Tour players that are exempt.”

Per Olsen’s interview with 730 WVFN:

“I heard he’s on a month suspension. And it’s kind of a strong witness, a credible person that’s telling me this… It’s not testosterone, but it’s something else. I think when it is all said and done, he is going to surpass Lance Armstrong with…a…infamy.”

Olsen didn’t stop at PED’s. He even goes as far as claiming Tiger Woods has allegedly been using questionable golf balls since the late 1990s. So questionable, in fact, that Nike has paid PGA Tour staff to pick up all the balls so no one get’s the balls.

“Tiger, he’s got some problems now. One of the big problems, Nike’s been giving Tiger a ball that I would almost bet hasn’t been tested…Rory played it too. Remember when Rory signed the Nike deal and he played like an amateur for a year? He was going to fail out of the contract unless he got the high-spin ball too… So if you go to Tour events, Nike pays them, pays the Tour staff and the range staff, they pay them to get all those balls back. That’s why Tiger would never sign a golf ball and give it away… He played a ball that nobody else could play.”

I have personally seen Rory McIlroy throw his golf balls into the stands, so I don’t know how valid this ball claim is. But, WOW. Dan Olsen must have very few fucks left to give if he’s publicly calling out Tiger Woods as a cheater on multiple levels.

Thanks to BroBible writer and PGA Tour caddie, Pinot Pete, for getting this interview on our radar. And while Pinot Pete could not corroborate Olsen’s claim — nor would he probably want to, because LAWSUITS — he did say, “I’ve known Dan Olsen for 10 years. And in all that time, I’ve never known him to stretch the truth.” So there’s that.","0"

Well, it’s not testosterone but it’s something else. I think when it’s all said and done he’s going to surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy…

WVFN host: Well, he’s already put a big dent in his situation with the circumstance he got himself into philandering behind his wife’s back…

"Tiger Woods selling Swedish villa — island included","Golfers, take note — Tiger Woods’ Swedish luxury island, complete with six tee-off locations, is now up for grabs.

In addition to being a golfer’s paradise, the 62-acre haven features a villa, hunting lodge, private ferry boat, horse stables and landing strip for propeller planes.

Sabine Rollinger of Vladi Private Islands, who are listing the island, told Mercury Press Agency that the escape is “unique due to its central location, as the Swedish capital is only about an hour away by boat or car, and from there you have swift access to the Stockholm archipelago.”

Lake Mälaren is an enviable swim destination, as the water temperature reaches up to 79 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer months.

Nordegren learned during Thanksgiving 2009 that Woods had been cheating on her, and soon after, his very public one-man SUV crash revealed their marital problems to the world.
Subsequent news reports said his dalliances involved perhaps a dozen women. Their divorce was finalized in August 2010.

"Tee-off in your own putting paradise: Swedish luxury island owned by Tiger Woods up for sale - and it comes with a villa, a hot tub and a lodge","Keen golfers can have their very own putting paradise if they snap up this luxury island previously owned by Tiger Woods.

The island in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, was one of the homes shared by the 14-time major winner and his ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, before their six-year marriage fell apart in 2010.

The 62-acre island features a secluded villa, a hunting lodge, its very own landing strip for propeller planes as well as, of course, six tee-off areas for a custom-made golf hole.

Very private: The 62-acre island previously home to Tiger Woods and his ex-wife Elin Nordegren

Riches: The island in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, was just one of the homes shared by golfer and his ex-wife

Secluded: The island's villa, built from wood cut from the island itself, according to the estate agents

Serene: The residence on the island is apparently the only home for many miles around

Rustic: Yet the wooden construction also includes modern conveniences like a hot tub and gas barbecue

Kitted out: The kitchen, including breakfast bar, wood-burning stove and a disguised extractor fan

Welcoming: The bedroom. Tiger Woods and his wife split after his infidelity became public

Room to live: The kitchen and living room share an open plan space with the wood ceiling rising high above

It also includes a protected quay, a private ferry boat, a historic hill fort, pasture land for horses, stables and two small Skinnpälsarna islands with a water area of around 500 acres.

But potential buyers will have to bring their own clubs as the main building comes unfurnished.

Sabine Rollinger of Vladi Private Islands, who are listing the island, told Mercury Press Agency: 'This island was owned by Tiger Woods but after his divorce he doesn't need an island in Sweden any more.

'This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy.

'It includes a private harbour, untouched woods, beautiful lush parks, open fields, striking lake views and a tastefully designed main residence, a mini-mansion.

'Also on the island is a landing strip and six tee-off areas for golf practice.

'The secluded villa, hunting lodge and stables are located on the main island and surrounded by a very large lawn.

Log cabin: The hunting lodge offers another space away from the main house for times you want to be alone

Fore! The island includes six teeing off areas for a single custom golf hole

Neigh: These are the stables on the island which, along with the private pasture, would be great for horses

Well lit: As darkness falls, you can see the house is tastefully illuminated by a number of external lights

Is that an outside swimming pool? If so, it's an ambitious choice for Sweden, with its long, chilly winters...

A luxury yacht on the island: The protected quay catches the evening sun and it's only an hour's boat ride from the island to the Stockholm archipelago and the sights and sounds of the Swedish capital

Happy times: Tiger bought the place when married to Swede Elin

'Here you can land your private prop airplane, play soccer, do some riding or enjoy unstructured golfing.

'A hundred metres from the villa is the private, protected bay, and a 50-metre long quay that provides plenty of space for your own, and your friends' boats.

"Tiger Woods Is Selling His Private Island For $7.1 Million","Tiger Woods divorced Swedish model Elin Nordegren in 2010, but he’s only now decided to unload his private island near Stockholm. The Los Angeles Times reports the luxury property has an asking price of $7.1 million.

The agency searching for a buyer made no secret of Woods’ motivation to sell. Sabine Rollinger, of Vladi Private Islands, said the property is of little practical use to the golf superstar.

“This island was owned by Tiger Woods but after his divorce he doesn’t need an island in Sweden any more.”

Nordegren told People in May of 2014 that she and Woods live a 25-minute drive apart in Southern Florida and share custody of their two children, daughter Sam and son Charlie. The children were, at that time, 6 and 5 respectively.

“I have moved on and I am in a good place. My relationship with Tiger is centered around our children and we are doing really good — we really are — and I am so happy that is the case. He is a great father.”

Nordegren gave the interview to People as she finally received her psychology degree after nine years of chipping away at courses. She graduated with a 3.96 GPA and gave the commencement address at her institution, Rollins College. Her speech made a silent reference to her marriage to Woods.

“Education has been the only consistent part of my life the last nine years. And it has offered me comfort. Education is one thing that no one can take away from you.”

The island is in Sweden’s Lake Mälaren and boasts a villa, hunting lodge, landing strip, stables, woods, lush parks, and tee-off area. There’s also a unique historical artifact: an 11th-century Viking stronghold. But anyone who buys the property will have to ferry in a couch, since the property is listed as unfurnished.

The Boston Herald reports that after Elin and Tiger’s divorce, they sold their home in Windermere, Florida, to another golf star, left-hander Bubba Watson. Woods’ extensive Florida compound is in Hobe Sound, Florida, and Nordegren’s Florida home is in North Palm Beach.

Last year, Tiger Woods’ career earnings surpassed the $1.3 billion mark. ESPN quotes a Golf Digest report in stating that 88 percent of those earnings were for endorsements off the green. In 2013, Woods made $12 million playing golf and $71 million in endorsements.

After revelations came to light about Woods’ infidelity, his endorsement earnings dropped to an all-time low of $62 million in 2011. He made $100 million in endorsements in each of 2008 and 2009.","0"

"Elderly Woman Arrested for Kidnapping Neighbor’s Cats & Making Fur Coats","An 85-year-old woman in Waco, Texas has been been arrested for allegedly kidnapping neighbor’s cats and making them into fur coats.

Local residents couldn’t figure out where their cats were disappearing, so one or more residents decided to hire a private investigator. Some even thought they saw their own cats as a part of her fur coats. Eventually, the investigator successfully videotaped the woman stealing a neighbor’s cat.

According to World News Daily Report, the woman admitted in court that she tried to raise her own cats, but became too attached to them.

Prior to being caught on tape, the woman denied all allegations.

Prosecutors allege that the retired fashion designer skinned the cats in her basement. The following is a photo of the woman wearing one of her fur coats:

"‘Little old lady’ Arrested for Making Fur Coats with Neighbor’s Cats","The recent disappearance of domestic animals in the neighborhood started to arise suspicion from local residents when some people started to notice the old lady’s particular fur coats, some even recognizing their cats in the coat’s furs, a fact the lady vehemently denied before being caught on videotape by a private detective hired by local residents to follow the suspicious lady.

It is believed the old lady started at first to raise her own cats but finally decided to capture neighboring cats because she “got too much attached to the little critters”, she admitted in court.

It is estimated she used over 30 cats to make one single fur coat and over 20 fur coats were found in her house during the arrest

The retired fashion designer lured neighborhood cats with food and skinned them in her basement where she dried the skins. She also used the meat of the cats to lure other cats who unwittingly were eating their own species, a disgusting and cruel hobby admits local PETA spokeswoman Jane Churchill.

Legal experts assess the 85-year old woman could spend up to 18 months in jail for her crimes.","0"
